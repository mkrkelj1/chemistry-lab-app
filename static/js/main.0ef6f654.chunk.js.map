If\n      the temperature of a solid is measured carefully as the solid is heated,\n      the temperature will be observed to rise until the melting point (m.p.) of\n      the solid is reached, and then the temperature will remain almost constant\n      while the solid melts. The heat absorbed during melting is the “heat of\n      fusion,” the energy needed to move the molecules out of the crystal\n      lattice of the solid. When the solid has completely melted, the addition\n      of more heat again contributes to an increase in the temperature of the\n      sample, now a liquid. This describes the melting of a pure solid. The\n      melting point is characteristic of the compound, independent of source,\n      purification procedure, etc., and is useful in identifying the compound.\n      However, many different compounds have identical or very similar melting\n      points.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      <strong>Functional Definition of Melting Point</strong>\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Strictly speaking, the melting point is never a “point”. It is invariably\n      a narrow range, about 1&deg; for most compounds, but 0.5&deg; for some,\n      1.5 – 2.0&deg; for others. Part of the range is an experimental artifact.\n      Since heat transfer is often uneven, all parts of a solid sample are\n      unlikely to be at the same temperature simultaneously. While some regions\n      of the sample may be at the melting point (solid and liquid in\n      equilibrium), other regions may be at slightly higher or lower\n      temperatures. Thus, visible melting will occur over a range of\n      temperatures. Therefore, the proper report of a melting point is the\n      temperature range from the first visible appearance of liquid\n      (distinguished from “softening” of the crystal) to the disappearance of\n      the last visible crystal of solid. The end is the most important point,\n      but the whole range is needed for full interpretation (e.g. benzoic acid,\n      m.p. = 120 – 121.5&deg;).\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Melting points for many organic compounds may be found in the CRC Handbook\n      of Chemistry and Physics (hbcponline.com). These “literature” melting\n      points are taken from reports in the chemical literature and indicate the\n      melting range or upper end of the melting range of very pure samples of\n      compounds. Consequently, these values are the highest values that can be\n      expected for each compound. (See below for effects of impurities on\n      melting points.) In some cases, more than one melting point will be listed\n      for a single compound. This usually means that the compound can exist in\n      more than one type of crystal lattice and that the different types have\n      different stabilities and thus will break down at different temperatures.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      <strong>Effects of an \"Impurity\"</strong>\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      If two different compounds, A and B, are intimately mixed, the melting\n      point behavior of the mixture differs from that of either pure compound.\n      When a small portion of B is mixed with A, the upper limit of the melting\n      point range of A is lowered. Increasing the amount of B in A continuously\n      decreases the upper limit of the melting range of the resultant mixture\n      until such point that B ceases to be the impurity in A, and A then becomes\n      the impurity in B. The point at which this occurs is called the eutectic;\n      the eutectic temperature and composition of a mixture varies with the\n      nature of the components A and B.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      <img\n        src={cache[\"./Identification_Background_MeltingCurve.png\"]}\n        alt=\"Table\"\n        width=\"90%\"\n      />\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      The melting point of a eutectic mixture is below that of either pure A or\n      pure B and is the lowest temperature at which any mixture of A and B can\n      melt. The lower limit of the melting range of all mixtures of A and B is\n      actually equal to the eutectic temperature because that part of the\n      mixtures which is of the eutectic composition melts at the eutectic\n      temperature. Actual observation of the true lower limit is difficult in\n      all mixtures and impossible in mixtures containing little of one\n      component. In most mixtures, the small amount of material that consists of\n      the eutectic composition, and therefore melts first, is obscured by the\n      relatively large amount of remaining “pure” component. The upper limit of\n      the melting range is more readily observed, since it is much easier to\n      note the disappearance of the last crystal in the liquid than appearance\n      of the first drop of liquid in the mass of solid. The upper limit of the\n      melting range of a compound containing an impurity is always lower than\n      that of the pure compound.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      <strong>Mixed Melting Points </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The melting point of a compound is a physical characteristic often used to\n      identify the compound and provide information about its purity. Pure\n      compounds melt sharply. The presence of an impurity in a sample lowers the\n      upper end of the melting range and very often causes the observed melting\n      range to be wider than that of the pure compound. Therefore, if two\n      samples of similar melting point are intimately mixed, and the melting\n      point of the mixture is not “depressed” or “broadened,” the two samples\n      are the same compound. As a corollary, if the melting point of the mixture\n      is depressed and possibly broadened, the two samples cannot be the same\n      compound. When attempting to identify a compound by the mixed melting\n      point method, it is critical to observe the melting behavior of the\n      unknown and standard side by side with the mixture. The procedure gives a\n      direct comparison of the mixture with the standards and allows you to\n      observe any variation of melting behavior between samples under your\n      experimental conditions. It is also useful to test a second possibility to\n      assure that under the conditions of your experiment the technique is\n      capable of distinguishing between different compounds.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n);\n\nconst results = () => (\n  <div>\n      <p>\n    <strong><a href={cache[\"./1_melting_points_coversheet.docx\"]}>Link to download report coversheet</a></strong>\n  </p>\n\n    <p>\n      <strong>Report your Results in a tabular format.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>(For this experiment, this may mean recopying your Data table.)</p>\n  </div>\n);\n\nconst study_questions = () => (\n  <div>\n    <ol>\n      <li>\n        Describe the effect on the melting point of mixing two different\n        compounds of similar melting points.\n      </li>\n\n      <li>\n        Identify your unknown.

In this\n      experiment, you will extract trimyristin from nutmeg powder and\n      recrystallize trimyristin.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Recrystallization is one of the most important purification techniques\n      used in organic chemistry. Recrystallization is used to purify solids\n      contaminated by relatively small amounts of solid impurities. Compounds\n      having different solubilities at different temperatures can generally be\n      recrystallized. For most compounds, the solubility increases as the\n      temperature of the solvent increases. In practice, this means that a\n      suitable solvent for recrystallization is one in which there is a large\n      difference between the solubility of the compound in hot solvent compared\n      with that in cold solvent. A compound which dissolves to form a saturated\n      solution at or near the boiling point of a suitable solvent can be largely\n      recovered since it will come out of the solvent, or recrystallize, when\n      the solution is cooled. If the compound is impure, removal of insoluble\n      impurities (by gravity filtration) is accomplished with the desired\n      product dissolved in the hot solution. Other impurities remain largely\n      dissolved even when the solution is cooled because they are more soluble\n      and/or present in much smaller amounts than the desired product.\n      Recrystallizations are designed, by proper use of solvents, to maximize\n      the yield and purity, although the degree of recovery and quality often\n      vary inversely.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <b>Choice of a suitable solvent:</b>\n    </p>\n    <ol type=\"a\">\n      <li>The desired compound should be very soluble in the hot solvent.</li>\n      <li>The desired compound is very insoluble in the cold solvent.</li>\n      <li>\n        The solvent should be easily removable (fairly volatile) from the\n        desired product.\n      </li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>\n      <b>Choice of a solvent pair:</b>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Sometimes no single solvent can fill the requirements of suitability. In\n      such cases, two miscible solvents (solvent pair) can be combined to\n      produce a suitable solvent.

Of these solvents, toluene is the least polar, and\n      water is the most polar.

Recrystallization is used to purify solids\n      contaminated by relatively small amounts of solid impurities. Compounds\n      having different solubilities at different temperatures can generally be\n      recrystallized. For most compounds, the solubility increases as the\n      temperature of the solvent increases. In practice, this means that a\n      suitable solvent for recrystallization is one in which there is a large\n      difference between the solubility of the compound in hot solvent compared\n      with that in cold solvent. A compound which dissolves to form a saturated\n      solution at or near the boiling point of a suitable solvent can be largely\n      recovered since it will come out of the solvent, or recrystallize, when\n      the solution is cooled. If the compound is impure, removal of insoluble\n      impurities (by gravity filtration) is accomplished with the desired\n      product dissolved in the hot solution. Other impurities remain largely\n      dissolved even when the solution is cooled because they are more soluble\n      and/or present in much smaller amounts than the desired product.\n      Recrystallizations are designed, by proper use of solvents, to maximize\n      the yield and purity, although the degree of recovery and quality often\n      vary inversely.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <b>Choice of a suitable solvent:</b>\n    </p>\n    <ol type=\"a\">\n      <li>The desired compound should be very soluble in the hot solvent.</li>\n      <li>The desired compound is very insoluble in the cold solvent.</li>\n      <li>\n        The solvent should be easily removable (fairly volatile) from the\n        desired product.\n      </li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>\n      <b>Choice of a solvent pair:</b>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Sometimes no single solvent can fill the requirements of suitability.

The theory of TLC and Column Chromatography will be\n      discussed in lab lecture. TLC is limited to small samples (only a few\n      milligrams). To handle larger amounts of material, more adsorbant is\n      needed. One common approach to larger scale separations is column\n      chromatography, where the adsorbant (usually silica gel or alumina) is\n      packed into a tube, and a continuous flow of solvent (eluant) is passed\n      through the adsorbant. As with TLC, the different compounds in the sample\n      are carried along, going back and forth between solvent and adsorbant. The\n      relative rates of these movements are dependent upon the relative\n      strengths of the attraction of these compounds to the adsorbant and upon\n      their solubilities in the eluant. With a polar adsorbant, the more polar\n      compounds in the sample will be held more tightly to the stationary phase\n      and move more slowly down the column. Therefore, when the same adsorbant\n      and solvent system are used in both, TLC and column chromatography will\n      yield the same order of elution for a given series of compounds. So, TLC\n      is a valuable tool for rapidly devising appropriate solvent systems for\n      column chromatography separations.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Unlike TLC, column chromatography is not limited to only one solvent\n      system for a given separation. Since the solvent is continuously supplied\n      at the top of the column, it is possible to change the eluting solvent at\n      any point in the separation. This advantage allows us to separate complex\n      mixtures containing compounds of widely varying polarity. For separations\n      of such samples, the column is prepared in a relatively non-polar solvent.\n      As the less polar components are eluted from the column, the polarity of\n      the solvent can be progressively increased, thus allowing selective\n      removal of compounds in order of increasing polarity.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In addition to this versatility for separating complex mixtures, column\n      chromatography has the advantage that it can be used for preparative scale\n      separations and purification, while TLC is usually limited to analytical\n      procedures. The amount of material to be separated can be varied from\n      milligrams to kilograms by increasing the size of the column and the\n      amount of adsorbant. For convenience and economy, the separation of a\n      mixture of ferrocene and acetyl ferrocene in our experiment will be done\n      on a semi-micro scale.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n);\n\nconst results = () => (\n  <div>\n\n<p>\n   <strong><a href={cache[\"./6_column_chromatography_coversheet.docx\"]}>Link to download report coversheet</a></strong>\n</p>\n\n\n    <p>Calculate the total % recovery, as in Experiment 3.</p>\n\n    <ol>\n      <li>\n        Calculate R<sub>f</sub> values for all spots and record in a table in\n        your notebook.\n      </li>\n      <li>Identify each spot.</li>\n      <li>\n        Find the weight of solid recovered from each fraction (ferrocene and\n        acetylferrocene).\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Calculate the total percent recovery: Total % recovery = % ferrocene + %\n        acetyl ferrocene\n      </li>\n\n      <strong>Sample Calculation:</strong>\n      <p>\n        % Ferrocene = (weight of ferrocene / weight of starting mixture) x 100\n      </p>\n    </ol>\n  </div>\n);\n\nconst study_questions = () => (\n  <div>\n    <p>\n      The R<sub>f</sub> values of three compounds on TLC plates developed with\n      10:1 hexane:acetone are (A) 0.33, (B) 0.91, and (C) 0.54.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      <ol>\n        <li>\n          {\" \"}\n          What would be their order of elution from an alumina column which is\n          eluted with 10:1 hexane:acetone (i.e., which would elute first, second\n          and third)?{\" \"}\n        </li>\n        <li>Explain your reasoning. </li>\n        <li>\n          What difference if any would be seen if the compounds were eluted from\n          the column with 7:1 hexane:acetone?

It is called extraction, and it is also\n        a common technique in everyday life. When you steep a tea bag in boiling\n        water, add a bay leaf to a pot of soup, or wash a load of laundry, you\n        are performing a solid/liquid extraction, in which a solution containing\n        several components is mixed with a second, immiscible liquid, for the\n        purpose of extracting one component of the solution into the second\n        solvent.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        We have seen that recrystallization is used to purify solids that are\n        contaminated by relatively small amounts of impurities. By contrast, the\n        technique of extraction is a more “coarse” or preliminary technique, in\n        that it can be used to separate one compound from another or from large\n        amounts of impurities.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Most <u>uncharged</u> organic molecules are more soluble in organic\n        solvents than in water. If the organic solvent itself is not very\n        soluble in water, then when the solvent or one of its solutions is mixed\n        with water, two layers will form, and the solvents are said to be{\" \"}\n        <u>immiscible</u>. The layers are called the <u>organic layer</u> and\n        the <u>aqueous layer</u>. If the two layers are shaken together, small\n        amounts of the components of the organic layer will dissolve in (or be\n        extracted into) the aqueous layer, and small amounts of the aqueous\n        layer components will dissolve (be extracted into) the organic layer,\n        establishing equilibrium between the two layers. Thus, if a neutral\n        compound C is initially dissolved in one layer (phase), it will be\n        distributed, or “partitioned,” between the two layers at equilibrium.\n        The distribution is expressed quantitatively in terms of the\n        coefficient, <b>K</b>. Ideally, the distribution coefficient of compound\n        C is equal to the ratio of the individual solubilities of C in pure\n        solvent, <b>S</b>, and in pure water, <b>W</b>.\n      </p>\n      <img\n        src={cache[\"./Extractionof2Unknowns_K.png\"]}\n        alt=\"K Equation\"\n        width=\"90%\"\n      />\n\n      <p>\n        For extraction of solute from solvent A into solvent B with a given\n        volume of solvent B, several extractions each with small portions of\n        solvent B are more efficient than a single extraction with the total\n        volume of solvent B.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        If several different solutes (P, Q, R) are dissolved in an organic\n        solvent, then shaking the solution with water will extract small amounts\n        of each into the aqueous layer, but not allow for a clean separation of\n        any one compound. However, if during the shaking we can run a reaction\n        which converts one of the solutes, P, into a product which is more\n        soluble in water than in the organic solvent (i.e., by converting it\n        into a charged ionic species, such as a conjugate base or conjugate\n        acid), the product will dissolve extensively in the aqueous layer and\n        thus can be separated from the other organic solutes. Now, if the\n        reaction can be reversed in the separated aqueous layer, we can recover\n        the original compound, P, separated from the other solutes, Q, and R.\n        Such a procedure is possible when the mixture contains an organic acid\n        (and/or base) that can be selectively converted to charged products\n        (salts).\n      </p>\n      <li>\n        <p>\n          <b>Acids and Bases in Organic Chemistry</b>\n        </p>\n      </li>\n      <p>\n        <b>Acids:</b>\n        <br />\n        RCOOH and ArCOOH (carboxylic acids)\n        <br />\n        ArOH (phenols), RSO<sub>3</sub>H (sulfonic acids)\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <b>Bases:</b>\n        <br />\n        RNH<sub>2</sub> (amines), ArNH<sub>2</sub> (anilines)\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The symbol R represents any alkyl group, such as CH<sub>3</sub>, C\n        <sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, etc. For an aromatic compound, such as C\n        <sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub> (benzene), the symbol Ar is used.

Before adding any liquid, <b>close the stopcock</b>. (It\n        is closed when it is perpendicular to the separatory funnel, and open\n        when parallel to it.) Just in case the stopcock may not be completely\n        closed, or it may leak a little, make it a habit to always have a\n        container, such as a beaker, under a separatory funnel. The two liquids\n        are added through the top of the separatory funnel. To allow for mixing\n        of the liquids, one-third to one-half of the separatory funnel should be\n        empty. The stopper is replaced. To mix the liquids, first secure the\n        stopper and invert the separatory funnel. Slowly open the stopcock to\n        vent any built-up pressure. Do not point it at your face or at any other\n        person. Then close the stopcock, hold the stopper firmly in, and shake\n        the funnel gently, a few times. Pause, invert, and vent again. Then\n        close the stopcock and shake some more, this time more vigorously. Open\n        the stopcock to vent again. Repeat this a few times, with longer shaking\n        intervals and harder shakes. Then replace the separatory funnel on the\n        iron ring to allow the solutions to separate.

Since we almost\n        always have an aqueous layer and an organic layer, you first need to\n        know which is which. Then you have to know which layer contains the\n        solute that you want to keep. The key to the first question is to know\n        the densities of the two solutions. This is one of the reasons that we\n        make a Table of Physical Constants for each experiment. This Table will\n        tell you the densities of the two solutions. Assigned readings also come\n        in handy here. Knowing in which layer a desired compound is found comes\n        from understanding the experiment and thinking about what you are doing.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        A good method to determine which layer is aqueous and which is organic\n        is to withdraw a few drops of one layer with a dropper and add these\n        drops to about 0.5 mL of water in a test tube. If the layer is organic,\n        the drops will be visible as a second phase; if it is aqueous, a\n        homogeneous solution will result.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <u>Always label</u> and <u>save</u> both layers from any extraction\n        until the end of the experiment.\n      </p>\n      <br />\n      <p>\n        <b>Drying the Extracts</b>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        After an aqueous extraction, organic solvents always contain some\n        dissolved or suspended water, which should be removed before any\n        dissolved compounds are isolated by solvent evaporation. This process is\n        called “drying” the extracts. Drying requires two steps. As a first\n        step, we perform one more extraction in each solution. We extract the\n        water from the organic layer by shaking it with water that is saturated\n        with sodium chloride, also called <b>brine</b>. This works because of an\n        osmotic effect. In the second step, the last traces of water are removed\n        from the organic layer with a drying agent, such as calcium chloride,\n        magnesium sulfate, sodium sulfate, or molecular sieves in their\n        anhydrous forms.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The amount of drying agent to use is determined empirically, since the\n        amount of water present is variable. In general, enough drying agent is\n        added to just cover the bottom of a flask, which is about 1/3 to 1/2\n        filled with the solution.

It is called extraction, and it is also\n        a common technique in everyday life. When you steep a tea bag in boiling\n        water, add a bay leaf to a pot of soup, or wash a load of laundry, you\n        are performing a solid/liquid extraction, in which a solution containing\n        several components is mixed with a second, immiscible liquid, for the\n        purpose of extracting one component of the solution into the second\n        solvent.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        We have seen that recrystallization is used to purify solids that are\n        contaminated by relatively small amounts of impurities. By contrast, the\n        technique of extraction is a more “coarse” or preliminary technique, in\n        that it can be used to separate one compound from another or from large\n        amounts of impurities.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Most <u>uncharged</u> organic molecules are more soluble in organic\n        solvents than in water. If the organic solvent itself is not very\n        soluble in water, then when the solvent or one of its solutions is mixed\n        with water, two layers will form, and the solvents are said to be{\" \"}\n        <u>immiscible</u>. The layers are called the <u>organic layer</u> and\n        the <u>aqueous layer</u>. If the two layers are shaken together, small\n        amounts of the components of the organic layer will dissolve in (or be\n        extracted into) the aqueous layer, and small amounts of the aqueous\n        layer components will dissolve (be extracted into) the organic layer,\n        establishing equilibrium between the two layers. Thus, if a neutral\n        compound C is initially dissolved in one layer (phase), it will be\n        distributed, or “partitioned,” between the two layers at equilibrium.\n        The distribution is expressed quantitatively in terms of the\n        coefficient, <b>K</b>. Ideally, the distribution coefficient of compound\n        C is equal to the ratio of the individual solubilities of C in pure\n        solvent, <b>S</b>, and in pure water, <b>W</b>.\n      </p>\n      <img\n        src={cache[\"./Extractionof2Unknowns_K.png\"]}\n        alt=\"K Equation\"\n        width=\"90%\"\n      />\n\n      <p>\n        For extraction of solute from solvent A into solvent B with a given\n        volume of solvent B, several extractions each with small portions of\n        solvent B are more efficient than a single extraction with the total\n        volume of solvent B.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        If several different solutes (P, Q, R) are dissolved in an organic\n        solvent, then shaking the solution with water will extract small amounts\n        of each into the aqueous layer, but not allow for a clean separation of\n        any one compound. However, if during the shaking we can run a reaction\n        which converts one of the solutes, P, into a product which is more\n        soluble in water than in the organic solvent (i.e., by converting it\n        into a charged ionic species, such as a conjugate base or conjugate\n        acid), the product will dissolve extensively in the aqueous layer and\n        thus can be separated from the other organic solutes. Now, if the\n        reaction can be reversed in the separated aqueous layer, we can recover\n        the original compound, P, separated from the other solutes, Q, and R.\n        Such a procedure is possible when the mixture contains an organic acid\n        (and/or base) that can be selectively converted to charged products\n        (salts).\n      </p>\n      <li>\n        <p>\n          <b>Acids and Bases in Organic Chemistry</b>\n        </p>\n      </li>\n      <p>\n        <b>Acids:</b>\n        <br />\n        RCOOH and ArCOOH (carboxylic acids)\n        <br />\n        ArOH (phenols), RSO<sub>3</sub>H (sulfonic acids)\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <b>Bases:</b>\n        <br />\n        RNH<sub>2</sub> (amines), ArNH<sub>2</sub> (anilines)\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The symbol R represents any alkyl group, such as CH<sub>3</sub>, C\n        <sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, etc. For an aromatic compound, such as C\n        <sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub> (benzene), the symbol Ar is used.

Distillation</strong>\n    <p>\n      Distillation is yet another method used to purify and/or separate organic\n      compounds. Recrystallization is used to purify compounds that are solids\n      at room temperature; distillation is used to purify compounds that are\n      liquids at room temperature.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In order to understand distillation, we must first consider the physical\n      property upon which the process is based, the boiling point of a liquid.\n      The boiling point may be defined as the temperature at which the vapor\n      pressure of a liquid is equal to the external pressure. Thus, the boiling\n      point of a liquid is directly proportional to the pressure above the\n      liquid. (Note: When heated in an open container, a liquid will boil when\n      its vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure.) Applying increasing\n      amounts of heat to a boiling liquid will cause it to boil faster (move\n      molecules from the liquid to the gas phase faster), and will not increase\n      the temperature of the liquid.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Distillation is the process in which a liquid is evaporated (boiled), and\n      its vapor condensed and collected. The simplest example of how\n      distillation can be used to purify compounds is the distillation of a\n      mixture containing one volatile and one non-volatile compound. The\n      volatile component vaporizes, leaving the non-volatile compound behind.\n      Thus, condensing and collecting the vapor will yield a pure sample of the\n      volatile compound. Separation of a mixture of two or more volatile\n      compounds is more complex. According to Raoult’s Law, the partial pressure\n      of a liquid in the vapor above a solution is equal to the vapor pressure\n      of the pure liquid times its mole fraction in the solution (P<sub>1</sub>{\" \"}\n      = P<sup>0</sup>X<sub>1</sub>). The total pressure above a mixture of\n      miscible liquids is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of each of\n      the liquids (P<sub>T</sub> = P<sup>0</sup>\n      <sub>1</sub>X<sub>1</sub> + P<sup>0</sup>\n      <sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub> + …). Since the vapor pressure of a liquid is\n      inversely proportional to its boiling point, the vapor above a mixture of\n      two miscible liquids contains a higher proportion of lower boiling\n      component than did the original mixture. (Consider a solution containing\n      50% A, b.p. 75 &#176;C + 50% B, b.p. 100 &#176;C. When the solution is\n      heated to its boiling point, the vapor above the boiling mixture will\n      contain &gt;50% A and &lt;50% B, therefore, the ratio of A:B will be\n      higher in the vapor than in the original solution.) Consequently, as the\n      vapor is removed by distillation, the liquid mixture becomes increasingly\n      richer in the higher boiling component, and its boiling temperature rises.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      If the vapor above the boiling liquid were condensed and revaporized, it\n      would produce new vapor, which was even richer in the lower boiling\n      component than the first vapor. An infinite series of these vaporizations,\n      condensations, and revaporizations would eventually lead to a vapor that\n      contained only the lower boiling component. If the lower boiling point\n      component could be selectively removed as it is formed, the two liquids\n      could be separated.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In practice, it is not necessary to repeat several separate distillations,\n      because the process called fractional distillation accomplishes multiple\n      distillations in one mechanical step. In a fractional distillation, the\n      mixture of liquids is heated to boiling in the distilling flask (pot). The\n      vapor rises up the fractionating column until it hits a cool surface\n      provided by the packing. The vapor cools, condenses, and begins to run\n      down the column. While this is occurring, heating of the pot continues.\n      Since the vapor removed at first was richer in the lower boiling\n      component, the mixture in the pot has become richer in the higher boiling\n      component, so its boiling point is higher and the temperature of the new\n      rising vapor, #2, is hotter than that of the first vapor, #1. This new\n      rising vapor, #2, hits the condensed vapor, #1, and transfers heat,\n      causing #1 to boil, forming new vapor #3, which is now the richest of all\n      in the lower boiling component. Vapor #3 rises in the column where it hits\n      a new cool surface, condenses, starts down the column where it is\n      “greeted” by hotter vapor; it revaporizes, rises further in the column,\n      and so on. In this way, a temperature gradient is established along the\n      column, with the hottest temperatures at the bottom (richest in high\n      boiling compound) and increasingly cooler temperatures toward the still\n      head (richest in lower boiling compound). Eventually, when the purest\n      sample of the lower boiling component reaches the still head (where the\n      thermometer is located), it enters the condenser and is collected.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      A plot of the stillhead temperature (temperature of the vapor about to be\n      condensed) vs. mL of distillate collected for distillations of various\n      efficiencies is shown below.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      src={cache[\"./Distillation_Temp.png\"]}\n      alt=\"Temperature Graph\"\n      width=\"90%\"\n    />\n\n    <p>\n      In an ideal distillation, the entire lower boiling component distills at\n      its boiling point, then the vapor temperature rises sharply to the boiling\n      point of the higher boiling component and it distills. If the collecting\n      flask is changed when the temperature rises suddenly, the components will\n      be collected separately, giving a perfect separation!\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In a fractional distillation, the early distillate distills at a\n      temperature a bit <u>above</u> the boiling point of the lower boiling\n      component. The last distillate comes over at a temperature slightly\n      <u>below</u> the higher boiling component.

In these\n      solutions, the dissimilar molecules are not indifferent to one another’s\n      presence. The resultant deviations from Raoult’s Law occur in either of\n      two directions. Some solutions display greater vapor pressures than\n      expected and are said to exhibit <u>positive deviation</u>.

All types of\n      chromatography utilize a two-phase system, consisting of a mobile phase\n      and a stationary phase.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Generally, the mixture to be separated is applied to one end of the\n      stationary phase and carried through the system by the mobile phase. The\n      system is chosen such that the components of the mixture have different\n      affinities for the stationary and mobile phases. Thus, as the mobile phase\n      carries the mixture over the stationary phase, the components of the\n      mixture reach different equilibria between the stationary and mobile\n      phases, and are “washed” through the system at different rates. If the\n      composition of the mobile phase is analyzed as the mobile phase exits the\n      system, different results will be obtained as time passes.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      If a mixture of Compounds A, B, and C is applied to the chromatography\n      system and the composition of the exiting mobile phase is monitored over\n      time, the following would be found:\n    </p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        Initially, the mobile phase would consist only of the mobile phase\n        component (gas or liquid).\n      </li>\n      <li>After a few minutes, Compound A would be detected.</li>\n      <li>\n        As time passes, Compound A would decrease in amount and then Compound B\n        would be detected.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        At later times, Compound B would decrease in amount and finally Compound\n        C would be detected.\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n      The lapse in time from the injection of a compound to its exit from the\n      column is called its “<b>retention time</b>”. Each compound has a\n      characteristic retention time, which depends upon the length of the\n      column, carrier gas flow rate, the temperature of the column, injection\n      block temperature, and the nature of the stationary phase.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In GC, as the name suggests, the mobile phase is a gas (usually N\n      <sub>2</sub>, He, Ne, or Ar). The stationary phase is either a solid, or\n      more often a liquid that is coated on solid particles. Usually, the\n      stationary phase particles are packed into glass or stainless steel tubing\n      and the mobile gas phase (carrier gas) flows through the tubing. This\n      packed tubing is called the chromatography “column.” Nowadays, capillary\n      columns are used. The most advantage of capillary GC column is the\n      separation efficiency and sensitivity enhancement as against the normal\n      packed columns due to the distance travelled by the analyte (sample\n      injected). These columns are open tubular columns, made of fused silica\n      with a polyimide coating on the outside surface. The stationary phase is\n      coated inside the tubing as a very thin layer (usually micrometer\n      thickness). The column length can be as long as 100 m. The internal\n      diameter of the tubing can vary from 0.1 mm to 0.53 mm or slightly more.\n      These columns will give much better separation for complex samples.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      As the gas flows out of the column, it passes through a detecting device,\n      which senses the ability of the gas to conduct heat. When compounds other\n      than the carrier gas are present, the conductivity of the gas mixture\n      increases and the detector sends an increased signal to a recorder. The\n      results of a separation such as that described for compounds A, B, and C\n      is shown below.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      src={cache[\"./Dehydration_prelabchart.png\"]}\n      alt=\"Dehydration Chart\"\n      width=\"80%\"\n    />\n    <p>\n      The relative amount of each component (A, B, or C) can be determined by\n      calculating the area under the peak corresponding to each component and\n      applying an appropriate sensitivity factor for the ability of the detector\n      to sense each compound.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      A simple and reasonably accurate method for determining the areas of peaks\n      is to treat them as symmetric triangles. Using this method, the area of a\n      peak is calculated by first measuring its vertical height and then the\n      width of the peak at half its height.

All types of\n      chromatography utilize a two-phase system, consisting of a mobile phase\n      and a stationary phase.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Generally, the mixture to be separated is applied to one end of the\n      stationary phase and carried through the system by the mobile phase. The\n      system is chosen such that the components of the mixture have different\n      affinities for the stationary and mobile phases. Thus, as the mobile phase\n      carries the mixture over the stationary phase, the components of the\n      mixture reach different equilibria between the stationary and mobile\n      phases, and are “washed” through the system at different rates. If the\n      composition of the mobile phase is analyzed as the mobile phase exits the\n      system, different results will be obtained as time passes.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      If a mixture of Compounds A, B, and C is applied to the chromatography\n      system and the composition of the exiting mobile phase is monitored over\n      time, the following would be found:\n    </p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        Initially, the mobile phase would consist only of the mobile phase\n        component (gas or liquid).\n      </li>\n      <li>After a few minutes, Compound A would be detected.</li>\n      <li>\n        As time passes, Compound A would decrease in amount and then Compound B\n        would be detected.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        At later times, Compound B would decrease in amount and finally Compound\n        C would be detected.\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n      The lapse in time from the injection of a compound to its exit from the\n      column is called its “<b>retention time</b>”. Each compound has a\n      characteristic retention time, which depends upon the length of the\n      column, carrier gas flow rate, the temperature of the column, injection\n      block temperature, and the nature of the stationary phase.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In GC, as the name suggests, the mobile phase is a gas (usually N\n      <sub>2</sub>, He, Ne, or Ar). The stationary phase is either a solid, or\n      more often a liquid that is coated on solid particles. Usually, the\n      stationary phase particles are packed into glass or stainless steel tubing\n      and the mobile gas phase (carrier gas) flows through the tubing. This\n      packed tubing is called the chromatography “column.” Nowadays, capillary\n      columns are used. The most advantage of capillary GC column is the\n      separation efficiency and sensitivity enhancement as against the normal\n      packed columns due to the distance travelled by the analyte (sample\n      injected). These columns are open tubular columns, made of fused silica\n      with a polyimide coating on the outside surface. The stationary phase is\n      coated inside the tubing as a very thin layer (usually micrometer\n      thickness). The column length can be as long as 100 m. The internal\n      diameter of the tubing can vary from 0.1 mm to 0.53 mm or slightly more.\n      These columns will give much better separation for complex samples.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      As the gas flows out of the column, it passes through a detecting device,\n      which senses the ability of the gas to conduct heat. When compounds other\n      than the carrier gas are present, the conductivity of the gas mixture\n      increases and the detector sends an increased signal to a recorder. The\n      results of a separation such as that described for compounds A, B, and C\n      is shown below.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      src={cache[\"./Dehydration_prelabchart.png\"]}\n      alt=\"Dehydration Chart\"\n      width=\"80%\"\n    />\n    <p>\n      The relative amount of each component (A, B, or C) can be determined by\n      calculating the area under the peak corresponding to each component and\n      applying an appropriate sensitivity factor for the ability of the detector\n      to sense each compound.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      A simple and reasonably accurate method for determining the areas of peaks\n      is to treat them as symmetric triangles.
