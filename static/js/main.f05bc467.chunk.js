The heat absorbed during melting is the \u201cheat of fusion,\u201d the energy needed to move the molecules out of the crystal lattice of the solid. When the solid has completely melted, the addition of more heat again contributes to an increase in the temperature of the sample, now a liquid. This describes the melting of a pure solid.

Since heat transfer is often uneven, all parts of a solid sample are unlikely to be at the same temperature simultaneously. While some regions of the sample may be at the melting point (solid and liquid in equilibrium), other regions may be at slightly higher or lower temperatures. Thus, visible melting will occur over a range of temperatures. Therefore, the proper report of a melting point is the temperature range from the first visible appearance of liquid (distinguished from \u201csoftening\u201d of the crystal) to the disappearance of the last visible crystal of solid.

In most mixtures, the small amount of material that consists of the eutectic composition, and therefore melts first, is obscured by the relatively large amount of remaining \u201cpure\u201d component. The upper limit of the melting range is more readily observed, since it is much easier to note the disappearance of the last crystal in the liquid than appearance of the first drop of liquid in the mass of solid.

Recrystallization is used to purify solids contaminated by relatively small amounts of solid impurities. Compounds having different solubilities at different temperatures can generally be recrystallized. For most compounds, the solubility increases as the temperature of the solvent increases. In practice, this means that a suitable solvent for recrystallization is one in which there is a large difference between the solubility of the compound in hot solvent compared with that in cold solvent. A compound which dissolves to form a saturated solution at or near the boiling point of a suitable solvent can be largely recovered since it will come out of the solvent, or recrystallize, when the solution is cooled. If the compound is impure, removal of insoluble impurities (by gravity filtration) is accomplished with the desired product dissolved in the hot solution. Other impurities remain largely dissolved even when the solution is cooled because they are more soluble and/or present in much smaller amounts than the desired product.

As you may have noticed, TLC is a rapid, easy method for separating mixtures of compounds. However, it is limited to small samples (only a few milligrams). To handle larger amounts of material, more adsorbant is needed. One common approach to larger scale separations is column chromatography, where the adsorbant (usually silica gel or alumina) is packed into a tube and a continuous flow of solvent (eluant) is passed through the adsorbant. As with TLC, the different compounds in the sample are carried along, going back and forth between solvent and adsorbant. The relative rates of these movements are dependent upon the relative strengths of the attraction of these compounds to the adsorbant and upon their solubilities in the eluant. With a polar adsorbant, the more polar compounds in the sample will be held more tightly to the stationary phase and move more slowly down the column.

The simplest example of how distillation can be used to purify compounds is the distillation of a mixture containing one volatile and one non-volatile compound. The volatile component vaporizes, leaving the non-volatile compound behind. Thus, condensing and collecting the vapor will yield a pure sample of the volatile compound. Separation of a mixture of two or more volatile compounds is more complex. According to Raoult\u2019s Law, the partial pressure of a liquid in the vapor above a solution is equal to the vapor pressure of the pure liquid times its mole fraction in the solution (P",l.a.createElement("sub",null,"1")," ","= P",l.a.createElement("sup",null,"0"),"X",l.a.createElement("sub",null,"1"),").

(Consider a solution containing 50% A, b.p. 75 \xb0C + 50% B, b.p. 100 \xb0C. When the solution is heated to its boiling point, the vapor above the boiling mixture will contain >50% A and <50% B, therefore, the ratio of A:B will be higher in the vapor than in the original solution.)

In a fractional distillation, the mixture of liquids is heated to boiling in the distilling flask (pot). The vapor rises up the fractionating column until it hits a cool surface provided by the packing. The vapor cools, condenses, and begins to run down the column. While this is occurring, heating of the pot continues. Since the vapor removed at first was richer in the lower boiling component, the mixture in the pot has become richer in the higher boiling component, so its boiling point is higher and the temperature of the new rising vapor, #2, is hotter than that of the first vapor, #1. This new rising vapor, #2, hits the condensed vapor, #1, and transfers heat, causing #1 to boil, forming new vapor #3, which is now the richest of all in the lower boiling component. Vapor #3 rises in the column where it hits a new cool surface, condenses, starts down the column where it is \u201cgreeted\u201d by hotter vapor; it revaporizes, rises further in the column, and so on.
