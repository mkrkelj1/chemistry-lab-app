If\n      the temperature of a solid is measured carefully as the solid is heated,\n      the temperature will be observed to rise until the melting point (m.p.) of\n      the solid is reached, and then the temperature will remain almost constant\n      while the solid melts. The heat absorbed during melting is the “heat of\n      fusion,” the energy needed to move the molecules out of the crystal\n      lattice of the solid. When the solid has completely melted, the addition\n      of more heat again contributes to an increase in the temperature of the\n      sample, now a liquid. This describes the melting of a pure solid. The\n      melting point is characteristic of the compound, independent of source,\n      purification procedure, etc., and is useful in identifying the compound.\n      However, many different compounds have identical or very similar melting\n      points.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      <strong>Functional Definition of Melting Point</strong>\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Strictly speaking, the melting point is never a “point”. It is invariably\n      a narrow range, about 1&deg; for most compounds, but 0.5&deg; for some,\n      1.5 – 2.0&deg; for others. Part of the range is an experimental artifact.\n      Since heat transfer is often uneven, all parts of a solid sample are\n      unlikely to be at the same temperature simultaneously. While some regions\n      of the sample may be at the melting point (solid and liquid in\n      equilibrium), other regions may be at slightly higher or lower\n      temperatures. Thus, visible melting will occur over a range of\n      temperatures. Therefore, the proper report of a melting point is the\n      temperature range from the first visible appearance of liquid\n      (distinguished from “softening” of the crystal) to the disappearance of\n      the last visible crystal of solid. The end is the most important point,\n      but the whole range is needed for full interpretation (e.g. benzoic acid,\n      m.p. = 120 – 121.5&deg;).\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Melting points for many organic compounds may be found in the CRC Handbook\n      of Chemistry and Physics (hbcponline.com). These “literature” melting\n      points are taken from reports in the chemical literature and indicate the\n      melting range or upper end of the melting range of very pure samples of\n      compounds. Consequently, these values are the highest values that can be\n      expected for each compound. (See below for effects of impurities on\n      melting points.) In some cases, more than one melting point will be listed\n      for a single compound. This usually means that the compound can exist in\n      more than one type of crystal lattice and that the different types have\n      different stabilities and thus will break down at different temperatures.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      <strong>Effects of an \"Impurity\"</strong>\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      If two different compounds, A and B, are intimately mixed, the melting\n      point behavior of the mixture differs from that of either pure compound.\n      When a small portion of B is mixed with A, the upper limit of the melting\n      point range of A is lowered. Increasing the amount of B in A continuously\n      decreases the upper limit of the melting range of the resultant mixture\n      until such point that B ceases to be the impurity in A, and A then becomes\n      the impurity in B. The point at which this occurs is called the eutectic;\n      the eutectic temperature and composition of a mixture varies with the\n      nature of the components A and B.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      <img\n        src={cache[\"./Identification_Background_MeltingCurve.png\"]}\n        alt=\"Table\"\n        width=\"90%\"\n      />\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      The melting point of a eutectic mixture is below that of either pure A or\n      pure B and is the lowest temperature at which any mixture of A and B can\n      melt. The lower limit of the melting range of all mixtures of A and B is\n      actually equal to the eutectic temperature because that part of the\n      mixtures which is of the eutectic composition melts at the eutectic\n      temperature. Actual observation of the true lower limit is difficult in\n      all mixtures and impossible in mixtures containing little of one\n      component. In most mixtures, the small amount of material that consists of\n      the eutectic composition, and therefore melts first, is obscured by the\n      relatively large amount of remaining “pure” component. The upper limit of\n      the melting range is more readily observed, since it is much easier to\n      note the disappearance of the last crystal in the liquid than appearance\n      of the first drop of liquid in the mass of solid. The upper limit of the\n      melting range of a compound containing an impurity is always lower than\n      that of the pure compound.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      <strong>Mixed Melting Points </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The melting point of a compound is a physical characteristic often used to\n      identify the compound and provide information about its purity. Pure\n      compounds melt sharply. The presence of an impurity in a sample lowers the\n      upper end of the melting range and very often causes the observed melting\n      range to be wider than that of the pure compound. Therefore, if two\n      samples of similar melting point are intimately mixed, and the melting\n      point of the mixture is not “depressed” or “broadened,” the two samples\n      are the same compound. As a corollary, if the melting point of the mixture\n      is depressed and possibly broadened, the two samples cannot be the same\n      compound. When attempting to identify a compound by the mixed melting\n      point method, it is critical to observe the melting behavior of the\n      unknown and standard side by side with the mixture. The procedure gives a\n      direct comparison of the mixture with the standards and allows you to\n      observe any variation of melting behavior between samples under your\n      experimental conditions. It is also useful to test a second possibility to\n      assure that under the conditions of your experiment the technique is\n      capable of distinguishing between different compounds.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n);\n\nconst results = () => (\n  <div>\n      <p>\n    <strong><a href={cache[\"./1_melting_points_coversheet.docx\"]}>Link to download report coversheet</a></strong>\n  </p>\n\n    <p>\n      <strong>Report your Results in a tabular format.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>(For this experiment, this may mean recopying your Data table.)</p>\n  </div>\n);\n\nconst study_questions = () => (\n  <div>\n    <ol>\n      <li>\n        Describe the effect on the melting point of mixing two different\n        compounds of similar melting points.\n      </li>\n\n      <li>\n        Identify your unknown.

In this\n      experiment, you will extract trimyristin from nutmeg powder and\n      recrystallize trimyristin.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Recrystallization is one of the most important purification techniques\n      used in organic chemistry. Recrystallization is used to purify solids\n      contaminated by relatively small amounts of solid impurities. Compounds\n      having different solubilities at different temperatures can generally be\n      recrystallized. For most compounds, the solubility increases as the\n      temperature of the solvent increases. In practice, this means that a\n      suitable solvent for recrystallization is one in which there is a large\n      difference between the solubility of the compound in hot solvent compared\n      with that in cold solvent. A compound which dissolves to form a saturated\n      solution at or near the boiling point of a suitable solvent can be largely\n      recovered since it will come out of the solvent, or recrystallize, when\n      the solution is cooled. If the compound is impure, removal of insoluble\n      impurities (by gravity filtration) is accomplished with the desired\n      product dissolved in the hot solution. Other impurities remain largely\n      dissolved even when the solution is cooled because they are more soluble\n      and/or present in much smaller amounts than the desired product.\n      Recrystallizations are designed, by proper use of solvents, to maximize\n      the yield and purity, although the degree of recovery and quality often\n      vary inversely.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <b>Choice of a suitable solvent:</b>\n    </p>\n    <ol type=\"a\">\n      <li>The desired compound should be very soluble in the hot solvent.</li>\n      <li>The desired compound is very insoluble in the cold solvent.</li>\n      <li>\n        The solvent should be easily removable (fairly volatile) from the\n        desired product.\n      </li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>\n      <b>Choice of a solvent pair:</b>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Sometimes no single solvent can fill the requirements of suitability. In\n      such cases, two miscible solvents (solvent pair) can be combined to\n      produce a suitable solvent.

Some commonly used solvents for recrystallization are\n      pentane, hexane, toluene, ethyl acetate, ethanol, methanol, and water.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In this experiment, we will use acetone, diethyl ether, toluene, methanol,\n      and water as solvents. Of these solvents, toluene is the least polar, and\n      water is the most polar. The normal procedure for the purification of a\n      compound by recrystallization is to predict its solubility on the basis of\n      its structure and then to test its solubility in a variety of solvents.\n      Once a suitable solvent is found, that compound can be recrystallized.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <b>Theory of Extraction</b>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The transfer of a solute from one phase to another is a very common\n      technique in organic chemistry.

Recrystallization is used to purify solids\n      contaminated by relatively small amounts of solid impurities. Compounds\n      having different solubilities at different temperatures can generally be\n      recrystallized. For most compounds, the solubility increases as the\n      temperature of the solvent increases. In practice, this means that a\n      suitable solvent for recrystallization is one in which there is a large\n      difference between the solubility of the compound in hot solvent compared\n      with that in cold solvent. A compound which dissolves to form a saturated\n      solution at or near the boiling point of a suitable solvent can be largely\n      recovered since it will come out of the solvent, or recrystallize, when\n      the solution is cooled. If the compound is impure, removal of insoluble\n      impurities (by gravity filtration) is accomplished with the desired\n      product dissolved in the hot solution. Other impurities remain largely\n      dissolved even when the solution is cooled because they are more soluble\n      and/or present in much smaller amounts than the desired product.\n      Recrystallizations are designed, by proper use of solvents, to maximize\n      the yield and purity, although the degree of recovery and quality often\n      vary inversely.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <b>Choice of a suitable solvent:</b>\n    </p>\n    <ol type=\"a\">\n      <li>The desired compound should be very soluble in the hot solvent.</li>\n      <li>The desired compound is very insoluble in the cold solvent.</li>\n      <li>\n        The solvent should be easily removable (fairly volatile) from the\n        desired product.\n      </li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>\n      <b>Choice of a solvent pair:</b>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Sometimes no single solvent can fill the requirements of suitability.

The theory of TLC and Column Chromatography will be\n      discussed in lab lecture. TLC is limited to small samples (only a few\n      milligrams). To handle larger amounts of material, more adsorbant is\n      needed. One common approach to larger scale separations is column\n      chromatography, where the adsorbant (usually silica gel or alumina) is\n      packed into a tube, and a continuous flow of solvent (eluant) is passed\n      through the adsorbant. As with TLC, the different compounds in the sample\n      are carried along, going back and forth between solvent and adsorbant. The\n      relative rates of these movements are dependent upon the relative\n      strengths of the attraction of these compounds to the adsorbant and upon\n      their solubilities in the eluant. With a polar adsorbant, the more polar\n      compounds in the sample will be held more tightly to the stationary phase\n      and move more slowly down the column. Therefore, when the same adsorbant\n      and solvent system are used in both, TLC and column chromatography will\n      yield the same order of elution for a given series of compounds. So, TLC\n      is a valuable tool for rapidly devising appropriate solvent systems for\n      column chromatography separations.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Unlike TLC, column chromatography is not limited to only one solvent\n      system for a given separation. Since the solvent is continuously supplied\n      at the top of the column, it is possible to change the eluting solvent at\n      any point in the separation. This advantage allows us to separate complex\n      mixtures containing compounds of widely varying polarity. For separations\n      of such samples, the column is prepared in a relatively non-polar solvent.\n      As the less polar components are eluted from the column, the polarity of\n      the solvent can be progressively increased, thus allowing selective\n      removal of compounds in order of increasing polarity.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In addition to this versatility for separating complex mixtures, column\n      chromatography has the advantage that it can be used for preparative scale\n      separations and purification, while TLC is usually limited to analytical\n      procedures. The amount of material to be separated can be varied from\n      milligrams to kilograms by increasing the size of the column and the\n      amount of adsorbant. For convenience and economy, the separation of a\n      mixture of ferrocene and acetyl ferrocene in our experiment will be done\n      on a semi-micro scale.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n);\n\nconst results = () => (\n  <div>\n\n<p>\n   <strong><a href={cache[\"./6_column_chromatography_coversheet.docx\"]}>Link to download report coversheet</a></strong>\n</p>\n\n\n    <p>Calculate the total % recovery, as in Experiment 3.</p>\n\n    <ol>\n      <li>\n        Calculate R<sub>f</sub> values for all spots and record in a table in\n        your notebook.\n      </li>\n      <li>Identify each spot.</li>\n      <li>\n        Find the weight of solid recovered from each fraction (ferrocene and\n        acetylferrocene).\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Calculate the total percent recovery: Total % recovery = % ferrocene + %\n        acetyl ferrocene\n      </li>\n\n      <strong>Sample Calculation:</strong>\n      <p>\n        % Ferrocene = (weight of ferrocene / weight of starting mixture) x 100\n      </p>\n    </ol>\n  </div>\n);\n\nconst study_questions = () => (\n  <div>\n    <p>\n      The R<sub>f</sub> values of three compounds on TLC plates developed with\n      10:1 hexane:acetone are (A) 0.33, (B) 0.91, and (C) 0.54.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      <ol>\n        <li>\n          {\" \"}\n          What would be their order of elution from an alumina column which is\n          eluted with 10:1 hexane:acetone (i.e., which would elute first, second\n          and third)?{\" \"}\n        </li>\n        <li>Explain your reasoning. </li>\n        <li>\n          What difference if any would be seen if the compounds were eluted from\n          the column with 7:1 hexane:acetone?

It is called extraction, and it is also\n        a common technique in everyday life. When you steep a tea bag in boiling\n        water, add a bay leaf to a pot of soup, or wash a load of laundry, you\n        are performing a solid/liquid extraction, in which a solution containing\n        several components is mixed with a second, immiscible liquid, for the\n        purpose of extracting one component of the solution into the second\n        solvent.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        We have seen that recrystallization is used to purify solids that are\n        contaminated by relatively small amounts of impurities. By contrast, the\n        technique of extraction is a more “coarse” or preliminary technique, in\n        that it can be used to separate one compound from another or from large\n        amounts of impurities.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Most <u>uncharged</u> organic molecules are more soluble in organic\n        solvents than in water. If the organic solvent itself is not very\n        soluble in water, then when the solvent or one of its solutions is mixed\n        with water, two layers will form, and the solvents are said to be{\" \"}\n        <u>immiscible</u>. The layers are called the <u>organic layer</u> and\n        the <u>aqueous layer</u>. If the two layers are shaken together, small\n        amounts of the components of the organic layer will dissolve in (or be\n        extracted into) the aqueous layer, and small amounts of the aqueous\n        layer components will dissolve (be extracted into) the organic layer,\n        establishing equilibrium between the two layers. Thus, if a neutral\n        compound C is initially dissolved in one layer (phase), it will be\n        distributed, or “partitioned,” between the two layers at equilibrium.\n        The distribution is expressed quantitatively in terms of the\n        coefficient, <b>K</b>. Ideally, the distribution coefficient of compound\n        C is equal to the ratio of the individual solubilities of C in pure\n        solvent, <b>S</b>, and in pure water, <b>W</b>.\n      </p>\n      <img\n        src={cache[\"./Extractionof2Unknowns_K.png\"]}\n        alt=\"K Equation\"\n        width=\"90%\"\n      />\n\n      <p>\n        For extraction of solute from solvent A into solvent B with a given\n        volume of solvent B, several extractions each with small portions of\n        solvent B are more efficient than a single extraction with the total\n        volume of solvent B.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        If several different solutes (P, Q, R) are dissolved in an organic\n        solvent, then shaking the solution with water will extract small amounts\n        of each into the aqueous layer, but not allow for a clean separation of\n        any one compound. However, if during the shaking we can run a reaction\n        which converts one of the solutes, P, into a product which is more\n        soluble in water than in the organic solvent (i.e., by converting it\n        into a charged ionic species, such as a conjugate base or conjugate\n        acid), the product will dissolve extensively in the aqueous layer and\n        thus can be separated from the other organic solutes. Now, if the\n        reaction can be reversed in the separated aqueous layer, we can recover\n        the original compound, P, separated from the other solutes, Q, and R.\n        Such a procedure is possible when the mixture contains an organic acid\n        (and/or base) that can be selectively converted to charged products\n        (salts).\n      </p>\n      <li>\n        <p>\n          <b>Acids and Bases in Organic Chemistry</b>\n        </p>\n      </li>\n      <p>\n        <b>Acids:</b>\n        <br />\n        RCOOH and ArCOOH (carboxylic acids)\n        <br />\n        ArOH (phenols), RSO<sub>3</sub>H (sulfonic acids)\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <b>Bases:</b>\n        <br />\n        RNH<sub>2</sub> (amines), ArNH<sub>2</sub> (anilines)\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The symbol R represents any alkyl group, such as CH<sub>3</sub>, C\n        <sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, etc. For an aromatic compound, such as C\n        <sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub> (benzene), the symbol Ar is used.

Before adding any liquid, <b>close the stopcock</b>. (It\n        is closed when it is perpendicular to the separatory funnel, and open\n        when parallel to it.) Just in case the stopcock may not be completely\n        closed, or it may leak a little, make it a habit to always have a\n        container, such as a beaker, under a separatory funnel. The two liquids\n        are added through the top of the separatory funnel. To allow for mixing\n        of the liquids, one-third to one-half of the separatory funnel should be\n        empty. The stopper is replaced. To mix the liquids, first secure the\n        stopper and invert the separatory funnel. Slowly open the stopcock to\n        vent any built-up pressure. Do not point it at your face or at any other\n        person. Then close the stopcock, hold the stopper firmly in, and shake\n        the funnel gently, a few times. Pause, invert, and vent again. Then\n        close the stopcock and shake some more, this time more vigorously. Open\n        the stopcock to vent again. Repeat this a few times, with longer shaking\n        intervals and harder shakes. Then replace the separatory funnel on the\n        iron ring to allow the solutions to separate.

Since we almost\n        always have an aqueous layer and an organic layer, you first need to\n        know which is which. Then you have to know which layer contains the\n        solute that you want to keep. The key to the first question is to know\n        the densities of the two solutions. This is one of the reasons that we\n        make a Table of Physical Constants for each experiment. This Table will\n        tell you the densities of the two solutions. Assigned readings also come\n        in handy here. Knowing in which layer a desired compound is found comes\n        from understanding the experiment and thinking about what you are doing.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        A good method to determine which layer is aqueous and which is organic\n        is to withdraw a few drops of one layer with a dropper and add these\n        drops to about 0.5 mL of water in a test tube. If the layer is organic,\n        the drops will be visible as a second phase; if it is aqueous, a\n        homogeneous solution will result.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <u>Always label</u> and <u>save</u> both layers from any extraction\n        until the end of the experiment.\n      </p>\n      <br />\n      <p>\n        <b>Drying the Extracts</b>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        After an aqueous extraction, organic solvents always contain some\n        dissolved or suspended water, which should be removed before any\n        dissolved compounds are isolated by solvent evaporation. This process is\n        called “drying” the extracts. Drying requires two steps. As a first\n        step, we perform one more extraction in each solution. We extract the\n        water from the organic layer by shaking it with water that is saturated\n        with sodium chloride, also called <b>brine</b>. This works because of an\n        osmotic effect. In the second step, the last traces of water are removed\n        from the organic layer with a drying agent, such as calcium chloride,\n        magnesium sulfate, sodium sulfate, or molecular sieves in their\n        anhydrous forms.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The amount of drying agent to use is determined empirically, since the\n        amount of water present is variable. In general, enough drying agent is\n        added to just cover the bottom of a flask, which is about 1/3 to 1/2\n        filled with the solution. The mixture is swirled and examined to be sure\n        that some of the drying agent remains freely suspended in the liquid as\n        it is swirled. If the entire drying agent sticks together, indicating\n        saturation with water, more is added until swirling shows some loose\n        material. Too large an excess of drying agent is to be avoided, since\n        some dissolved material will be lost by adsorption on the surface of the\n        drying agent.\n      </p>\n      <br />\n      <p>\n        <b>Recovery of Compounds</b>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        After the organic solutions have been dried, the drying agent is removed\n        by gravity filtration, and the solvent is evaporated, to leave the now\n        pure compound.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  );\n\n  const procedure_2 = () => (\n    <div>\n      <p>\n        <b>Experimental Procedures</b>\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        In this experiment, you will be given an unknown that consists of a\n        mixture of two components, an acid and a neutral compound, both solids.\n        You will separate these compounds by an acid/base extraction.

It is called extraction, and it is also\n        a common technique in everyday life. When you steep a tea bag in boiling\n        water, add a bay leaf to a pot of soup, or wash a load of laundry, you\n        are performing a solid/liquid extraction, in which a solution containing\n        several components is mixed with a second, immiscible liquid, for the\n        purpose of extracting one component of the solution into the second\n        solvent.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        We have seen that recrystallization is used to purify solids that are\n        contaminated by relatively small amounts of impurities. By contrast, the\n        technique of extraction is a more “coarse” or preliminary technique, in\n        that it can be used to separate one compound from another or from large\n        amounts of impurities.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Most <u>uncharged</u> organic molecules are more soluble in organic\n        solvents than in water. If the organic solvent itself is not very\n        soluble in water, then when the solvent or one of its solutions is mixed\n        with water, two layers will form, and the solvents are said to be{\" \"}\n        <u>immiscible</u>. The layers are called the <u>organic layer</u> and\n        the <u>aqueous layer</u>. If the two layers are shaken together, small\n        amounts of the components of the organic layer will dissolve in (or be\n        extracted into) the aqueous layer, and small amounts of the aqueous\n        layer components will dissolve (be extracted into) the organic layer,\n        establishing equilibrium between the two layers. Thus, if a neutral\n        compound C is initially dissolved in one layer (phase), it will be\n        distributed, or “partitioned,” between the two layers at equilibrium.\n        The distribution is expressed quantitatively in terms of the\n        coefficient, <b>K</b>. Ideally, the distribution coefficient of compound\n        C is equal to the ratio of the individual solubilities of C in pure\n        solvent, <b>S</b>, and in pure water, <b>W</b>.\n      </p>\n      <img\n        src={cache[\"./Extractionof2Unknowns_K.png\"]}\n        alt=\"K Equation\"\n        width=\"90%\"\n      />\n\n      <p>\n        For extraction of solute from solvent A into solvent B with a given\n        volume of solvent B, several extractions each with small portions of\n        solvent B are more efficient than a single extraction with the total\n        volume of solvent B.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        If several different solutes (P, Q, R) are dissolved in an organic\n        solvent, then shaking the solution with water will extract small amounts\n        of each into the aqueous layer, but not allow for a clean separation of\n        any one compound. However, if during the shaking we can run a reaction\n        which converts one of the solutes, P, into a product which is more\n        soluble in water than in the organic solvent (i.e., by converting it\n        into a charged ionic species, such as a conjugate base or conjugate\n        acid), the product will dissolve extensively in the aqueous layer and\n        thus can be separated from the other organic solutes. Now, if the\n        reaction can be reversed in the separated aqueous layer, we can recover\n        the original compound, P, separated from the other solutes, Q, and R.\n        Such a procedure is possible when the mixture contains an organic acid\n        (and/or base) that can be selectively converted to charged products\n        (salts).\n      </p>\n      <li>\n        <p>\n          <b>Acids and Bases in Organic Chemistry</b>\n        </p>\n      </li>\n      <p>\n        <b>Acids:</b>\n        <br />\n        RCOOH and ArCOOH (carboxylic acids)\n        <br />\n        ArOH (phenols), RSO<sub>3</sub>H (sulfonic acids)\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <b>Bases:</b>\n        <br />\n        RNH<sub>2</sub> (amines), ArNH<sub>2</sub> (anilines)\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The symbol R represents any alkyl group, such as CH<sub>3</sub>, C\n        <sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, etc. For an aromatic compound, such as C\n        <sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub> (benzene), the symbol Ar is used.

Distillation</strong>\n    <p>\n      Distillation is yet another method used to purify and/or separate organic\n      compounds. Recrystallization is used to purify compounds that are solids\n      at room temperature; distillation is used to purify compounds that are\n      liquids at room temperature.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In order to understand distillation, we must first consider the physical\n      property upon which the process is based, the boiling point of a liquid.\n      The boiling point may be defined as the temperature at which the vapor\n      pressure of a liquid is equal to the external pressure. Thus, the boiling\n      point of a liquid is directly proportional to the pressure above the\n      liquid. (Note: When heated in an open container, a liquid will boil when\n      its vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure.) Applying increasing\n      amounts of heat to a boiling liquid will cause it to boil faster (move\n      molecules from the liquid to the gas phase faster), and will not increase\n      the temperature of the liquid.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Distillation is the process in which a liquid is evaporated (boiled), and\n      its vapor condensed and collected. The simplest example of how\n      distillation can be used to purify compounds is the distillation of a\n      mixture containing one volatile and one non-volatile compound. The\n      volatile component vaporizes, leaving the non-volatile compound behind.\n      Thus, condensing and collecting the vapor will yield a pure sample of the\n      volatile compound. Separation of a mixture of two or more volatile\n      compounds is more complex. According to Raoult’s Law, the partial pressure\n      of a liquid in the vapor above a solution is equal to the vapor pressure\n      of the pure liquid times its mole fraction in the solution (P<sub>1</sub>{\" \"}\n      = P<sup>0</sup>X<sub>1</sub>). The total pressure above a mixture of\n      miscible liquids is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of each of\n      the liquids (P<sub>T</sub> = P<sup>0</sup>\n      <sub>1</sub>X<sub>1</sub> + P<sup>0</sup>\n      <sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub> + …). Since the vapor pressure of a liquid is\n      inversely proportional to its boiling point, the vapor above a mixture of\n      two miscible liquids contains a higher proportion of lower boiling\n      component than did the original mixture. (Consider a solution containing\n      50% A, b.p. 75 &#176;C + 50% B, b.p. 100 &#176;C. When the solution is\n      heated to its boiling point, the vapor above the boiling mixture will\n      contain &gt;50% A and &lt;50% B, therefore, the ratio of A:B will be\n      higher in the vapor than in the original solution.) Consequently, as the\n      vapor is removed by distillation, the liquid mixture becomes increasingly\n      richer in the higher boiling component, and its boiling temperature rises.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      If the vapor above the boiling liquid were condensed and revaporized, it\n      would produce new vapor, which was even richer in the lower boiling\n      component than the first vapor. An infinite series of these vaporizations,\n      condensations, and revaporizations would eventually lead to a vapor that\n      contained only the lower boiling component. If the lower boiling point\n      component could be selectively removed as it is formed, the two liquids\n      could be separated.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In practice, it is not necessary to repeat several separate distillations,\n      because the process called fractional distillation accomplishes multiple\n      distillations in one mechanical step. In a fractional distillation, the\n      mixture of liquids is heated to boiling in the distilling flask (pot). The\n      vapor rises up the fractionating column until it hits a cool surface\n      provided by the packing. The vapor cools, condenses, and begins to run\n      down the column. While this is occurring, heating of the pot continues.\n      Since the vapor removed at first was richer in the lower boiling\n      component, the mixture in the pot has become richer in the higher boiling\n      component, so its boiling point is higher and the temperature of the new\n      rising vapor, #2, is hotter than that of the first vapor, #1. This new\n      rising vapor, #2, hits the condensed vapor, #1, and transfers heat,\n      causing #1 to boil, forming new vapor #3, which is now the richest of all\n      in the lower boiling component. Vapor #3 rises in the column where it hits\n      a new cool surface, condenses, starts down the column where it is\n      “greeted” by hotter vapor; it revaporizes, rises further in the column,\n      and so on. In this way, a temperature gradient is established along the\n      column, with the hottest temperatures at the bottom (richest in high\n      boiling compound) and increasingly cooler temperatures toward the still\n      head (richest in lower boiling compound). Eventually, when the purest\n      sample of the lower boiling component reaches the still head (where the\n      thermometer is located), it enters the condenser and is collected.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      A plot of the stillhead temperature (temperature of the vapor about to be\n      condensed) vs. mL of distillate collected for distillations of various\n      efficiencies is shown below.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      src={cache[\"./Distillation_Temp.png\"]}\n      alt=\"Temperature Graph\"\n      width=\"90%\"\n    />\n\n    <p>\n      In an ideal distillation, the entire lower boiling component distills at\n      its boiling point, then the vapor temperature rises sharply to the boiling\n      point of the higher boiling component and it distills. If the collecting\n      flask is changed when the temperature rises suddenly, the components will\n      be collected separately, giving a perfect separation!\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In a fractional distillation, the early distillate distills at a\n      temperature a bit <u>above</u> the boiling point of the lower boiling\n      component. The last distillate comes over at a temperature slightly\n      <u>below</u> the higher boiling component. Liquid mixtures boil at\n      temperatures <u>between</u> the boiling points of the components.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In a simple distillation, the initial temperature is higher and the final\n      temperature is lower than in the fractional distillation.

In these\n      solutions, the dissimilar molecules are not indifferent to one another’s\n      presence. The resultant deviations from Raoult’s Law occur in either of\n      two directions. Some solutions display greater vapor pressures than\n      expected and are said to exhibit <u>positive deviation</u>.

All types of\n      chromatography utilize a two-phase system, consisting of a mobile phase\n      and a stationary phase.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Generally, the mixture to be separated is applied to one end of the\n      stationary phase and carried through the system by the mobile phase. The\n      system is chosen such that the components of the mixture have different\n      affinities for the stationary and mobile phases. Thus, as the mobile phase\n      carries the mixture over the stationary phase, the components of the\n      mixture reach different equilibria between the stationary and mobile\n      phases, and are “washed” through the system at different rates. If the\n      composition of the mobile phase is analyzed as the mobile phase exits the\n      system, different results will be obtained as time passes.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      If a mixture of Compounds A, B, and C is applied to the chromatography\n      system and the composition of the exiting mobile phase is monitored over\n      time, the following would be found:\n    </p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        Initially, the mobile phase would consist only of the mobile phase\n        component (gas or liquid).\n      </li>\n      <li>After a few minutes, Compound A would be detected.</li>\n      <li>\n        As time passes, Compound A would decrease in amount and then Compound B\n        would be detected.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        At later times, Compound B would decrease in amount and finally Compound\n        C would be detected.\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n      The lapse in time from the injection of a compound to its exit from the\n      column is called its “<b>retention time</b>”. Each compound has a\n      characteristic retention time, which depends upon the length of the\n      column, carrier gas flow rate, the temperature of the column, injection\n      block temperature, and the nature of the stationary phase.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In GC, as the name suggests, the mobile phase is a gas (usually N\n      <sub>2</sub>, He, Ne, or Ar). The stationary phase is either a solid, or\n      more often a liquid that is coated on solid particles. Usually, the\n      stationary phase particles are packed into glass or stainless steel tubing\n      and the mobile gas phase (carrier gas) flows through the tubing. This\n      packed tubing is called the chromatography “column.” Nowadays, capillary\n      columns are used. The most advantage of capillary GC column is the\n      separation efficiency and sensitivity enhancement as against the normal\n      packed columns due to the distance travelled by the analyte (sample\n      injected). These columns are open tubular columns, made of fused silica\n      with a polyimide coating on the outside surface. The stationary phase is\n      coated inside the tubing as a very thin layer (usually micrometer\n      thickness). The column length can be as long as 100 m. The internal\n      diameter of the tubing can vary from 0.1 mm to 0.53 mm or slightly more.\n      These columns will give much better separation for complex samples.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      As the gas flows out of the column, it passes through a detecting device,\n      which senses the ability of the gas to conduct heat. When compounds other\n      than the carrier gas are present, the conductivity of the gas mixture\n      increases and the detector sends an increased signal to a recorder. The\n      results of a separation such as that described for compounds A, B, and C\n      is shown below.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      src={cache[\"./Dehydration_prelabchart.png\"]}\n      alt=\"Dehydration Chart\"\n      width=\"80%\"\n    />\n    <p>\n      The relative amount of each component (A, B, or C) can be determined by\n      calculating the area under the peak corresponding to each component and\n      applying an appropriate sensitivity factor for the ability of the detector\n      to sense each compound.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      A simple and reasonably accurate method for determining the areas of peaks\n      is to treat them as symmetric triangles. Using this method, the area of a\n      peak is calculated by first measuring its vertical height and then the\n      width of the peak at half its height.

All types of\n      chromatography utilize a two-phase system, consisting of a mobile phase\n      and a stationary phase.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Generally, the mixture to be separated is applied to one end of the\n      stationary phase and carried through the system by the mobile phase. The\n      system is chosen such that the components of the mixture have different\n      affinities for the stationary and mobile phases. Thus, as the mobile phase\n      carries the mixture over the stationary phase, the components of the\n      mixture reach different equilibria between the stationary and mobile\n      phases, and are “washed” through the system at different rates. If the\n      composition of the mobile phase is analyzed as the mobile phase exits the\n      system, different results will be obtained as time passes.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      If a mixture of Compounds A, B, and C is applied to the chromatography\n      system and the composition of the exiting mobile phase is monitored over\n      time, the following would be found:\n    </p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        Initially, the mobile phase would consist only of the mobile phase\n        component (gas or liquid).\n      </li>\n      <li>After a few minutes, Compound A would be detected.</li>\n      <li>\n        As time passes, Compound A would decrease in amount and then Compound B\n        would be detected.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        At later times, Compound B would decrease in amount and finally Compound\n        C would be detected.\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n      The lapse in time from the injection of a compound to its exit from the\n      column is called its “<b>retention time</b>”. Each compound has a\n      characteristic retention time, which depends upon the length of the\n      column, carrier gas flow rate, the temperature of the column, injection\n      block temperature, and the nature of the stationary phase.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In GC, as the name suggests, the mobile phase is a gas (usually N\n      <sub>2</sub>, He, Ne, or Ar). The stationary phase is either a solid, or\n      more often a liquid that is coated on solid particles. Usually, the\n      stationary phase particles are packed into glass or stainless steel tubing\n      and the mobile gas phase (carrier gas) flows through the tubing. This\n      packed tubing is called the chromatography “column.” Nowadays, capillary\n      columns are used. The most advantage of capillary GC column is the\n      separation efficiency and sensitivity enhancement as against the normal\n      packed columns due to the distance travelled by the analyte (sample\n      injected). These columns are open tubular columns, made of fused silica\n      with a polyimide coating on the outside surface. The stationary phase is\n      coated inside the tubing as a very thin layer (usually micrometer\n      thickness). The column length can be as long as 100 m. The internal\n      diameter of the tubing can vary from 0.1 mm to 0.53 mm or slightly more.\n      These columns will give much better separation for complex samples.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      As the gas flows out of the column, it passes through a detecting device,\n      which senses the ability of the gas to conduct heat. When compounds other\n      than the carrier gas are present, the conductivity of the gas mixture\n      increases and the detector sends an increased signal to a recorder. The\n      results of a separation such as that described for compounds A, B, and C\n      is shown below.\n    </p>\n    <img\n      src={cache[\"./Dehydration_prelabchart.png\"]}\n      alt=\"Dehydration Chart\"\n      width=\"80%\"\n    />\n    <p>\n      The relative amount of each component (A, B, or C) can be determined by\n      calculating the area under the peak corresponding to each component and\n      applying an appropriate sensitivity factor for the ability of the detector\n      to sense each compound.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      A simple and reasonably accurate method for determining the areas of peaks\n      is to treat them as symmetric triangles. Using this method, the area of a\n      peak is calculated by first measuring its vertical height and then the\n      width of the peak at half its height.

The initial step is a nitration reaction, a type\n      of electrophilic aromatic substitution, in which a nitro group replaces\n      one of the hydrogens on the benzene ring. Next, amide hydrolysis provides\n      para-nitroaniline, which is separated from the ortho-isomer by\n      recrystallization.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <img\n        src={cache[\"./16_image5.png\"]} \n        alt=\"Figure 1: Summary of reactions to synthesize p-Nitroaniline\"\n        width=\"90%\"\n      />\n    </p>\n    <div>Figure 1: Summary of reactions to synthesize p-Nitroaniline</div>\n    <p>\n      The challenge of starting from simple materials to synthesize more complex\n      molecules is central to organic chemistry. Your synthetic target,\n      p-nitroaniline is commercially available for $4.56/g. Let us assume that\n      this exorbitant price charged by Aldrich is beyond your means, but that\n      you have access to cheap, readily available starting materials in your\n      laboratory. The problem is to devise a step or a series of steps\n      connecting your synthetic target to those starting materials. In planning\n      this route, think initially in terms of an overall plan or strategy,\n      leaving the operational details or tactics for later. A retrosynthetic\n      approach is a synthetic strategy that involves starting the product and\n      working backwards toward potential starting materials. Identify a key\n      group in the molecule that you are trying to make, and ask yourself what\n      precursors you could use to construct that key structural feature.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <img\n   \n        src={cache[\"./16_image4.png\"]} \n        alt=\"Figure 2. Retrosynthetic analysis of p-Nitroaniline\"\n        width=\"90%\"\n      />\n    </p>\n    <div>Figure 2. Retrosynthetic analysis of p-Nitroaniline</div>\n    <p>\n      For this experiment the target, p-nitroaniline, is a nitro- substituted\n      aniline. Without worrying exactly how the aryl amine will be converted to\n      the nitro compound, the chemist uses the retrosynthetic arrow to show that\n      the nitro function in the target &ldquo;suggests as a starting\n      material&rdquo; aniline (Figure 2). Given your knowledge of electrophilic\n      aromatic substitution, a para-substituted nitroaniline suggests for its\n      synthesis a nitration reaction, with the corresponding aniline as the\n      starting material. Aniline is a common chemical found on a laboratory\n      shelf. Aldrich sells aniline for about $0.06/g.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The tactical aspects of the p-nitroaniline synthesis are left for you to\n      consider. It is a matter of providing specific reagents and methods for\n      making the synthetic connection between aniline and p-nitroaniline. This\n      time, you will work in the forward direction. Finally, the detailed\n      synthesis plan is put to the ultimate test in the laboratory. Few\n      syntheses proceed exactly as planned. It is a measure of your skill as an\n      organic chemist to overcome obstacles and bring a well-conceived synthetic\n      scheme to a successful conclusion.\n    </p>\n    <div>\n      <h2>Video</h2>\n      <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKHUnHDphTc\">\n        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKHUnHDphTc\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n      <p>\n        <strong>\n          <em>Notes:</em>\n        </strong>{\" \"}\n        Usually, the reaction flask is heated in an oil bath or sand bath.

When adding water and hydrochloric acid to the reaction flask\n        via a funnel (7:13), be sure to secure the funnel with a ring stand. DO\n        NOT touch hot RBF (8:32).

The molecule contains an iron(II) center,\n      sandwiched between two organic fragments. The metal center is equally\n      bonded to each of the 10 carbons of the planar cyclopentadienyl rings, and\n      the resulting bright orange compound is remarkably stable to water and\n      heat. Ferrocene is quite non-polar (<em>R</em>\n      <sub>\n        <em>f</em>\n      </sub>{\" \"}\n      &asymp; 1 in TLC experiments using hexanes to elute a sample on a SiO\n      <sub>2</sub>-coated TLC plate). Its cyclopentadienyl anion is prepared by\n      deprotonation of cyclopentadiene, using potassium hydroxide as the base in\n      diethyl ether solvent. Cyclopentadiene readily dimerizes to\n      dicyclopentadiene and must be freshly prepared by thermal cracking of the\n      dimer. The cracking process involves a retro Diels-Alder reaction.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Critical to an understanding of the ferrocene synthesis is an appreciation\n      for the aromatic character of the cyclopentadienyl anion. The p<em>K</em>a\n      of a cyclopentadiene methylene (-CH<sub>2</sub>-) hydrogen suggests that\n      the conjugate base, cyclopentadienyl anion, is very stable relative to the\n      anions derived from other hydrocarbons. The p<em>K</em>a of\n      cyclopentadiene is around 16, roughly equal to that of water. Compare this\n      value to that for the much less acidic allylic hydrogen of cyclohexadiene\n      (Figure 1).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <img\n       \n        src={cache[\"./18_image9.png\"]}\n        alt=\"Figure 1: Relative acidities of cyclopentadiene and cyclohexadiene\"\n        width=\"90%\"\n      />\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The pKa data indicate that it is relatively easy to form the\n      cyclopentadienyl anion. It is much more stable than the corresponding\n      cyclohexadienyl anion. The more stable cyclopentadienyl anion is planar,\n      with all carbons sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized and a continuous, cyclic array\n      of five 2p orbitals aligned perpendicular to the molecular plane (Figure\n      2). Six (4n+2, with n=1) 𝜋-electrons are delocalized over this cyclic\n      array, satisfying the H&uuml;ckel condition for aromaticity. The aromatic\n      character of the cyclopentadienyl anion renders it quite stable relative\n      to other carbanions. It is stable enough that it forms readily upon\n      exposure of cyclopentadiene to potassium hydroxide in diethyl ether.\n      Formation of the anion is evident from its pink color in this solvent.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <img\n       \n        src={cache[\"./18_image6.png\"]}\n        alt=\"Figure 2: The pi-system of the cyclopentadienyl anion comprises a cyclic array of five 2p orbitals\"\n        width=\"90%\"\n      />\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Cyclopentadienyl anion is stable, for a carbanion-but it is still readily\n      deprotonated upon exposure to moisture. Moreover, FeCl<sub>2</sub>&bull;H\n      <sub>2</sub>O is readily oxidized by atmospheric oxygen. Therefore, you\n      will have to conduct the ferrocene synthesis in dry glassware and under an\n      atmosphere of nitrogen. Many reactions in organic chemistry are moisture-\n      or air-sensitive or both. The ability to work under anhydrous conditions\n      and under an inert atmosphere is a vital skill for the practicing organic\n      chemist.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Complexation with iron(II) stabilizes the cyclopentadienyl anion, as the\n      organic fragment shares its six 𝜋-electrons with the metal center. The\n      valence electron count at the iron(II) center in ferrocene becomes 12 from\n      the two cyclopentadienyl ligands, plus 6 from the metal itself, for a\n      total of 18 electrons. This is a particularly stable electronic\n      configuration for the metal, representing frilled 4s, 3d, and 4p shells\n      (Krypton-like). The &ldquo;18-electron rule&rdquo; for transition metals\n      is analogous to the more familiar octet rule for the main group elements.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <img\n        \n        src={cache[\"./18_image1.png\"]}\n        alt=\"Figure 3: Friedel-Crafts acetylation of ferrocene\"\n        width=\"90%\"\n      />\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The cyclopentadienyl rings in ferrocene retain their aromatic character.\n      You will explore their reactivity in an electrophilic aromatic\n      substitution reaction as you prepare acetylferrocene (Figure 3). The\n      acetylated material is more polar and darker-colored than the starting\n      ferrocene. Column chromatography is well suited for separating the\n      acetylferrocene product from an unreacted ferrocene. You will be able to\n      monitor elution of the colored ferrocene and acetylferrocene bands from\n      the chromatography column visually. You will characterize both ferrocene\n      and acetylferrocene by MP determination and NMR spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>\n      H and <sup>13</sup>C).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>\n        Videos (There are some discrepancies between the video and the procedure\n        listed below.

This reaction is\n      termed esterification reaction, a type of substitution reaction, in which\n      the hydrogen in the RCOO<strong>H</strong> group is replaced by a\n      hydrocarbon (<strong>R&rsquo; </strong>or <strong>Ar</strong>). Thus,\n      carboxylic esters have the general formula RCOOR&rsquo; where R and\n      R&rsquo; may be an alkyl or an aryl group. Naturally occurring esters in\n      fruits and flowers give them their characteristic smell. For example,\n      3-methylbutyl ethanoate is artificial banana flavor; octyl acetate is\n      artificial orange flavor. Dietary fats are chemically triglycerides, an\n      ester formed from fatty acids and glycerol (a tri-alcohol).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <img\n        src={cache[\"./19_image7.png\"]}\n        alt=\"Figure 1: Esterification reaction\"\n        width=\"90%\"\n      />\n    </p>\n    <p style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n      <strong>Figure 1. Esterification reaction</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The nomenclature for esters is based on the structure of its components;\n      you must look at the section of the ester containing the carbonyl group\n      (as coming from the carboxylic acid) and the section containing the oxygen\n      atom and the remaining carbon atoms (as coming from the alcohol) (Figure\n      2). Then, count the number of carbons in those two sections and assign the\n      correct prefix based on the number of carbon atoms (meth-, eth-, prop-,\n      etc.) (Figure 2). The nomenclature for esters is structured so that the\n      alcohol-derived section is referenced first, with the ending -yl (ethyl)\n      and the carbonyl section is referenced second, with the ending -oate\n      (propanoate). In the example below (Figure 2), the carbonyl section has 2\n      carbon atoms and the alcohol-derived section has 3 carbon atoms, so the\n      formal nomenclature for this molecule is propyl ethanoate.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <img\n        src={cache[\"./19_image10.png\"]}\n        alt=\"Figure 2: Diagram for determining nomenclature of esters\"\n        width=\"90%\"\n      />\n    </p>\n    <p style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n      <strong>Figure 2.

The ester is divided into the two sections and the\n      structures are evaluated. A benzene ring in the alcohol-derived section is\n      called phenyl; the ester shown in figure 3A is called phenyl ethanoate. A\n      benzene ring as part of a carbonyl group (consisting of the 6 carbons of\n      the benzene ring and the carbon of the C=O bond) is called benzoate; the\n      ester shown in figure 3B is called ethyl benzoate.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <img\n        src={cache[\"./19_image11.png\"]}\n        alt=\"Figure 3: A) Phenyl ethanoate B) Ethyl benzoate\"\n        width=\"90%\"\n      />\n    </p>\n    <p style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n      <strong>Figure 3. A) Phenyl ethanoate B) Ethyl benzoate</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      When dealing with esters with branched carbon chains, again the same\n      method of dividing the ester is used along with a similar method to naming\n      branched alkanes. The ester sections are divided and the longest chain of\n      carbons in each section is numbered and given the appropriate prefix.\n      Numbered carbons that have additional groups attached are identified and\n      named according to their number in the chain and the group attached. For\n      example, the ester shown in figure 4, the carbonyl section has a branched\n      alkane. The longest chain is 4 carbons, so the base name is butanoate\n      (but- because 4 carbons, -oate because it is the carbonyl section). The\n      second carbon in that chain has an additional methyl group attached, so\n      that entire section is named 2-methylbutanoate. The alcohol-derived\n      section of the ester consists of a simple methyl group, so the name of the\n      entire ester is methyl 2-methylbutanoate.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <img\n        src={cache[\"./19_image13.png\"]}\n        alt=\"Figure 4: Diagram showing method of naming methyl 2-methylbutanoate\"\n        width=\"90%\"\n      />\n    </p>\n    <p style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n      <strong>\n        Figure 4. Diagram showing method of naming methyl 2-methylbutanoate\n      </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Other groups that may be attached to esters are named in the same method\n      and the group names are the same as in other nomenclature: an -OH group is\n      referred to as hydroxy-, a chlorine atom is referred to as chloro-, and an\n      =O is referred to as -oxo. For example, if the molecule above in figure 4\n      had a chlorine atom attached to carbon 2 instead of a methyl group, the\n      name would be methyl 2-chlorobutanoate. Molecules that have more than one\n      group attached to the main carbon chain are named in sequential order of\n      the carbons with groups. Methyl 4-chloro-5-oxoheptanoate would have a\n      chlorine attached to carbon 4 and an oxygen atom attached to carbon 5 of\n      the 7 carbon chain in the carbonyl section.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In summary, the method for naming esters begins by dividing the molecule\n      into a section containing the carbonyl group (assumed to be derived from\n      the carboxylic acid) and a section containing the oxygen atom and\n      remaining carbon chain (assumed to be coming from the alcohol component).\n      The longest chains in both sections are numbered and named according to\n      their length; the alcohol-derived section is given the suffix <em>-yl</em>{\" \"}\n      and the carbonyl section is given the suffix <em>-onate</em>. Additional\n      groups are added to the name in sequential order of the base chain.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The nomenclature for an ester can be used to easily identify the\n      carboxylic acid and alcohol from which the ester can be synthesized. The\n      section containing the carbonyl group reflects the structure of the\n      component carboxylic acid and the section containing the oxygen atom and\n      remaining carbon atoms reflects the structure of the alcohol. The ester\n      shown in figure 1 (propyl ethanoate) can be synthesized from an alcohol\n      with 3 carbons (propanol) and a carboxylic acid with 2 carbons (formal\n      nomenclature ethanoic acid, common name acetic acid).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      You will observe the typical synthesis and purification of an ester (butyl\n      ethanoate) from a carboxylic acid and an alcohol in this experiment. The\n      esterification of carboxylic acids with alcohols is slow and reversible,\n      usually catalyzed by Lewis of Br&oslash;nstedt acids (Fischer\n      esterification). The equilibrium may be influenced by either removing one\n      product from the reaction mixture (for example, removal of the water by\n      azeotropic distillation or absorption by molecular sieve) or by employing\n      an excess of one reactant. In our experiment, this is accomplished by\n      adding an excess of carboxylic acid. The unreacted acid is removed by\n      extraction into an aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (Scheme 1).\n    </p>\n    <p style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n      2 RCOOH +2 NaHCO<sub>3</sub> &rarr; 2 RCOO<sup>-</sup> Na<sup>+</sup>+ H\n      <sub>2</sub>O\n    </p>\n    <p style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n      <strong>Scheme 1&nbsp;</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In your post-lab assignment, you will write a lab report based on the\n      video synthesis of butyl ethanoate and answer theoretical questions on\n      synthesis of other esters by esterification.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Videos</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aq8iJUpW5w\">\n        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aq8iJUpW5w\n      </a>\n    </p>\n    <h1>References</h1>\n    <ol>\n      <li>Handbook of Chemistry and Physics</li>\n    </ol>\n  </div>\n);\n\nconst procedure = () => {\n  const procedure_1 = () => <div> N/A </div>;\n  const procedureArray = [procedure_1()];\n  return procedureArray;\n};\n\nconst results = () => (\n  <div>\n    <ol>\n      <li>\n        All reports should be uploaded to Canvas under the appropriate heading\n        in the Assignments section.

Enolization can take place in either acidic conditions\n      (resulting in an enol) or basic conditions (resulting in an enolate).\n      Typically, the keto form dominates at equilibrium.

The exact nature of the Grignard\n      reagent in solution is unknown. It is believed to be a mixture of numerous\n      species. These species are highly solvated by ether and are complexed with\n      one another. It is customary to represent the Grignard reagent by the\n      formula RMgX when writing chemical equations, but it should be kept in\n      mind that the species in solution are of a much more complex nature.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <img\n       \n        src={cache[\"./21_image14.png\"]}\n        alt=\"Equation 1.

Preparation of the Grignard reagent, RMgX</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The ether solvent is an essential part of the Grignard reagent, for ether\n      is known to form a complex with the magnesium which is present in the\n      reagent. Several cases are known where the Grignard reagents have been\n      prepared in the absence of ether, but the yields are not good.\n      Satisfactory yields are usually obtained when the ether is present. The\n      most common ether solvent is ethyl ether, (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)\n      <sub>2</sub>O, due to its low cost and ease of removal (its boiling point\n      is 36 &deg;C). The organic halide may, in general, be of any organic\n      moiety (alkyl or aryl) and the halide may be bromide, chloride, or iodide.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The preparation of the Grignard reagent must be carried out under\n      anhydrous conditions and, if possible, in the absence of oxygen. In the\n      laboratory, we would have conducted this experiment in an inert N\n      <sub>2</sub> atmosphere; however the video demonstration is conducted in\n      the presence of oxygen. The procedure in the lab manual notes where and\n      how N<sub>2</sub> should be used while conducting this experiment, but it\n      should be noted that the video of the preparation of the Grignard reagent\n      differs in this way.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      It is exceedingly important to maintain completely dry conditions\n      throughout, for the presence of water inhibits the initiation of the\n      reaction, as well as destroying the reagent once it is formed.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The reaction that occurs when the Grignard reagent comes in contact with\n      water is shown in equation 2.\n    </p>\n    <p style={{ paddingLeft: \"90px\" }}>\n      RMgX + H<sub>2</sub>O &rarr; RH + HOMgX (2)\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The reagent is a strong base, as one of the carbon atoms bears substantial\n      negative charge (R<sup>-</sup> Mg<sup>2+</sup>X<sup>-</sup>). The Grignard\n      reagent, acting as a base, removes a proton from water, which acts as an\n      acid. The overall effect is the destruction of the reagent, with the\n      formation of a hydrocarbon (RH) and a basic magnesium salt. Other\n      compounds, such as alcohols and carboxylic acids, also destroy the\n      Grignard reagent by analogous acid-base reactions.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In addition to the reaction with water (equation 2), there are other side\n      reactions that may occur during formation of the Grignard reagent, as\n      shown in equations 3-5.\n    </p>\n    <p>Reaction with Oxygen:</p>\n    <p style={{ paddingLeft: \"90px\" }}>\n      2RMgX + O<sub>2</sub> &rarr; 2 RO<sup>-</sup>+MgX (3)&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>Reaction with Carbon Dioxide:</p>\n    <p style={{ paddingLeft: \"90px\" }}>\n      RMgX + CO<sub>2</sub> &rarr; RCO<sup>2-</sup> +MgX (4)&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>Coupling:</p>\n    <p style={{ paddingLeft: \"90px\" }}>\n      RMgX + RX &rarr; R-R + MgX<sub>2</sub> (5)\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      It is possible to minimize these reactions by taking certain precautions\n      when carrying out the experimental work. The reactions with oxygen and\n      with carbon dioxide may be avoided by carrying out the reaction under an\n      inert atmosphere (such as nitrogen or helium gas). For many practical\n      purposes, an insert gas is not essential since, when ethyl ether is used\n      as a solvent, it excludes a certain amount of air from the reaction vessel\n      due to its very high vapor pressure.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The coupling reaction (equation 5) is an example of a Wurtz reaction. It\n      is not possible to eliminate this coupling reaction completely, but it may\n      be minimized by using dilute solutions so as to avoid localized high\n      concentrations of halide. This can be done by using very efficient\n      stirring and by slowly adding the halide to the magnesium in ether.\n      Normally the rate of addition of halide (dissolved in ether) and the rate\n      of reflux (when ethyl ether is used) should be adjusted so that they are\n      about equal. Alkyl iodides are much more prone to coupling reactions than\n      are the bromides and chlorides, so that the latter are preferable for\n      preparing Grignard reagents even though they are less reactive. If water\n      has been carefully excluded, the most important side reaction is the\n      coupling process, but it is not a significant problem. Once the reagent is\n      prepared, it is used directly in subsequent reactions. The small amount of\n      by-product need not be separated from the reagent before adding the\n      carbonyl compound.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Videos:</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Set-up video:{\" \"}\n      <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X70AKnefB-4\">\n        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X70AKnefB-4\n      </a>\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        This video shows the set-up of apparatus as would be done in the lab.\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n      Video of preparation of Grignard reagent:{\" \"}\n      <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsrB0wPmnVM\">\n        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsrB0wPmnVM\n      </a>\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        Students should note that the video is done under oxygen atmosphere and\n        uses drying tube.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Students may start at the video at 4:11 (when reaction starts to happen,\n        bromobenzene, Mg, and ether have been added to RBF).

(Try not to insert the grass rod through the bottom of the RBF or the palm of your hand.) Initiation of the reaction is indicated by a slight cloudiness in the solution and by bubbles on the surface of the Mg. As soon as the reaction starts, reconnect the nitrogen, and connect the RBF to the condenser. Begin stirring.</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Handle glassware with care.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>9. Take the remaining PhBr-ether solution in the same 5 mL syringe. Insert the needle of this syringe through the septum. Add the solution to the RBF dropwise over a period of about 10 minutes. (<em>In video, a dropping funnel is used instead of a syringe to add PhBr-ether dropwise). </em>Adjust the rate of addition to maintain a gentle reflux of the ether. If the reaction becomes too vigorous, cool the bottom of the RBF in a beaker of room temperature water. When the spontaneous boiling of the mixture becomes slow, immerse the bottom of the RBF in a beaker of warm water (about 40&deg; C), and reflux the mixture gently until nearly all of the Mg has disintegrated or no further change is seen (about 15 min). The solution of phenyl magnesium bromide should look brownish and may be slightly cloudy. If the volume of solution has decreased to less than about half the volume of the RBF, add enough anhydrous ether (with your either syringe through the vent needle) to bring the volume back to about half the RBF.

Remove all of the unknown solution from the vial with the syringe and add it dropwise to the Grignard solution, as before, at such a rate that GENTLE reflux is maintained. The reaction is very exothermic. The reaction can be controlled, if necessary, by cooling the RBF in a beaker of water (room temperature). It is very important to mix the solution thoroughly by stirring well after each drop is added. After the addition of a few drops, a precipitate may form that makes mixing very inefficient.

For example, camphor is\n      used as a preservative in pharmaceuticals, in cosmetics, and even in\n      embalming fluids.

Reduction of camphor</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The products differ in the way in which the metal hydride reducing agent\n      delivers a hydride ion to the planar carbonyl group. Stereochemical\n      demands of the substrate, in this case camphor, can direct the addition of\n      metal hydride to one of two faces of the carbonyl. If much more of one\n      product is formed, the reaction can be said to be stereoselective. By\n      determining which (if either) product is preferentially formed, it is\n      possible to determine if and how the stereochemical demands of camphor are\n      controlling the reduction reaction.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Once the product(s) are isolated and identified, it becomes possible to\n      determine if the reduction was stereospecific by measuring the optical\n      rotation of the starting material and product(s). If the reduction was\n      stereospecific, optically pure (+)- or (-)-camphor should form only (+)-\n      or (-)-borneol, or only (+)- or (-)-isoborneol, with no loss of optical\n      purity.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In this experiment, you will start with either (+)- or (-)-camphor. (The\n      camphor to be used will be assigned by your instructor.) From the sign of\n      the optical rotations of the starting camphor and of the product(s), you\n      can confirm the identity of the product(s) and determine the\n      stereoselectivity, by determining if one of the expected products, borneol\n      or isoborneol, is formed in greater amount. (You could also evaluate the\n      stereospecificity by measuring optical rotation of both the starting\n      material and the isolated purified product(s) and determining the optical\n      purity or enantiomeric excess of each.)\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Video&nbsp;</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIZcelp7vlo&amp;list=PLCAB4E62EFB56C602\">\n        <strong>\n          https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIZcelp7vlo&amp;list=PLCAB4E62EFB56C602\n        </strong>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        Note this is a playlist of videos; make sure to watch all the videos in\n        the correct order.&nbsp;\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        The first part of this playlist shows how to use volumetric flasks to\n        make a sample for polarimetry.
