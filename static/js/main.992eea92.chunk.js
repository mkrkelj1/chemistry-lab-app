The heat absorbed during melting is the \u201cheat of fusion,\u201d the energy needed to move the molecules out of the crystal lattice of the solid. When the solid has completely melted, the addition of more heat again contributes to an increase in the temperature of the sample, now a liquid. This describes the melting of a pure solid.

Since heat transfer is often uneven, all parts of a solid sample are unlikely to be at the same temperature simultaneously. While some regions of the sample may be at the melting point (solid and liquid in equilibrium), other regions may be at slightly higher or lower temperatures. Thus, visible melting will occur over a range of temperatures. Therefore, the proper report of a melting point is the temperature range from the first visible appearance of liquid (distinguished from \u201csoftening\u201d of the crystal) to the disappearance of the last visible crystal of solid.

In most mixtures, the small amount of material that consists of the eutectic composition, and therefore melts first, is obscured by the relatively large amount of remaining \u201cpure\u201d component. The upper limit of the melting range is more readily observed, since it is much easier to note the disappearance of the last crystal in the liquid than appearance of the first drop of liquid in the mass of solid.

The theory of TLC and Column Chromatography will be discussed in lab lecture. TLC is limited to small samples (only a few milligrams). To handle larger amounts of material, more adsorbant is needed. One common approach to larger scale separations is column chromatography, where the adsorbant (usually silica gel or alumina) is packed into a tube, and a continuous flow of solvent (eluant) is passed through the adsorbant. As with TLC, the different compounds in the sample are carried along, going back and forth between solvent and adsorbant. The relative rates of these movements are dependent upon the relative strengths of the attraction of these compounds to the adsorbant and upon their solubilities in the eluant. With a polar adsorbant, the more polar compounds in the sample will be held more tightly to the stationary phase and move more slowly down the column. Therefore, when the same adsorbant and solvent system are used in both, TLC and column chromatography will yield the same order of elution for a given series of compounds. So, TLC is a valuable tool for rapidly devising appropriate solvent systems for column chromatography separations."),i.a.createElement("p",null,"Unlike TLC, column chromatography is not limited to only one solvent system for a given separation. Since the solvent is continuously supplied at the top of the column, it is possible to change the eluting solvent at any point in the separation. This advantage allows us to separate complex mixtures containing compounds of widely varying polarity. For separations of such samples, the column is prepared in a relatively non-polar solvent. As the less polar components are eluted from the column, the polarity of the solvent can be progressively increased, thus allowing selective removal of compounds in order of increasing polarity."),i.a.createElement("p",null,"In addition to this versatility for separating complex mixtures, column chromatography has the advantage that it can be used for preparative scale separations and purification, while TLC is usually limited to analytical procedures.

The boiling point may be defined as the temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid is equal to the external pressure. Thus, the boiling point of a liquid is directly proportional to the pressure above the liquid. (Note: When heated in an open container, a liquid will boil when its vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure.) Applying increasing amounts of heat to a boiling liquid will cause it to boil faster (move molecules from the liquid to the gas phase faster), and will not increase the temperature of the liquid."),i.a.createElement("p",null,"Distillation is the process in which a liquid is evaporated (boiled), and its vapor condensed and collected. The simplest example of how distillation can be used to purify compounds is the distillation of a mixture containing one volatile and one non-volatile compound. The volatile component vaporizes, leaving the non-volatile compound behind. Thus, condensing and collecting the vapor will yield a pure sample of the volatile compound. Separation of a mixture of two or more volatile compounds is more complex. According to Raoult\u2019s Law, the partial pressure of a liquid in the vapor above a solution is equal to the vapor pressure of the pure liquid times its mole fraction in the solution (P",i.a.createElement("sub",null,"1")," ","= P",i.a.createElement("sup",null,"0"),"X",i.a.createElement("sub",null,"1"),").

Since the vapor pressure of a liquid is inversely proportional to its boiling point, the vapor above a mixture of two miscible liquids contains a higher proportion of lower boiling component than did the original mixture. (Consider a solution containing 50% A, b.p. 75 \xb0C + 50% B, b.p. 100 \xb0C. When the solution is heated to its boiling point, the vapor above the boiling mixture will contain >50% A and <50% B, therefore, the ratio of A:B will be higher in the vapor than in the original solution.) Consequently, as the vapor is removed by distillation, the liquid mixture becomes increasingly richer in the higher boiling component, and its boiling temperature rises."),i.a.createElement("p",null,"If the vapor above the boiling liquid were condensed and revaporized, it would produce new vapor, which was even richer in the lower boiling component than the first vapor.

If the lower boiling point component could be selectively removed as it is formed, the two liquids could be separated."),i.a.createElement("p",null,"In practice, it is not necessary to repeat several separate distillations, because the process called fractional distillation accomplishes multiple distillations in one mechanical step. In a fractional distillation, the mixture of liquids is heated to boiling in the distilling flask (pot). The vapor rises up the fractionating column until it hits a cool surface provided by the packing. The vapor cools, condenses, and begins to run down the column. While this is occurring, heating of the pot continues. Since the vapor removed at first was richer in the lower boiling component, the mixture in the pot has become richer in the higher boiling component, so its boiling point is higher and the temperature of the new rising vapor, #2, is hotter than that of the first vapor, #1. This new rising vapor, #2, hits the condensed vapor, #1, and transfers heat, causing #1 to boil, forming new vapor #3, which is now the richest of all in the lower boiling component. Vapor #3 rises in the column where it hits a new cool surface, condenses, starts down the column where it is \u201cgreeted\u201d by hotter vapor; it revaporizes, rises further in the column, and so on. In this way, a temperature gradient is established along the column, with the hottest temperatures at the bottom (richest in high boiling compound) and increasingly cooler temperatures toward the still head (richest in lower boiling compound).
