##### YOU MAY NEVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WORK IN THE LABORATORY OUTSIDE OF YOUR ASSIGNED LABORATORY PERIOD WITHOUT PERMISSION FROM THE INSTRUCTOR.
---

##### A. Safety goggles must be worn at all times.
It is not advisable to wear contact lenses in the laboratory. Reading glasses are
not appropriate. If chemicals come in contact with your eyes, flush copiously with
water for at least five minutes. (Eyewash stations will be demonstrated during the
safety lecture.)

##### B. Lab coats should be worn when working in the laboratory.

##### C. Accidents:
Flush all chemical splashes with copious amounts of water. Use eyewash
stations for chemicals in your eyes and apply handfuls of water to clothing. Also
wash out liberally with water. Consult with the instructor concerning further
treatment.

##### D. Fire Hazards
1. No burners are to be used for heating in this laboratory. All heating will be
done with steam baths, hot baths, or electric heating mantles. The
solvents used in the laboratory, such as alcohols, ethers, petroleum ether,
etc., are highly flammable. All solvents must be kept away from flames.

2. NO SMOKING IN THE LABORATORY OR ANYWHERE ON THIS
CAMPUS.

3. In case of fire, REMAIN CALM! Most fires are contained in beakers or
flasks and can be easily smothered by covering with a watch glass or
fireproof plate. More extensive flames should be smothered using a
carbon dioxide extinguisher. Since water does not dissolve many organic
solvents, it will **not** extinguish most fires, but will cause them to spread. So **do not** use water on a fire.

##### E. General Safety

1. Keep long hair tied back, out of the way of chemicals and equipment.
2. Beware of hot glassware. Do not touch until it has had time to cool.
3. To insert glass tubes or thermometers through rubber stoppers or
adapters, first lubricate with glycerin or stopcock grease; hold the glass
with a towel, cloth, or other hand protection. Hold the glass tube or
thermometer near the end being inserted.
4. **No food or drink is allowed in the laboratory at any time!**


##### F. Laboratory Neatness
NEATNESS is essential for safety and for efficient work in the laboratory.

1. Keep the lab uncluttered by leaving unnecessary items in the locker. Push
back the chairs and stools to their position after using them.
2. If you spill anything on a balance pan or in the balance area, clean it up
immediately and leave a clean balance for your neighbor. Balance doors
should be closed after using the balance. Please cooperate.
3. If you spill acids, bases, or other corrosive chemicals, inform the instructor immediately.

##### G. Use of Reagents

- [Please watch this video on how to properly use the ventilation hood.](https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Lid_NYy1Rw)

1. USE REAGENT BOTTLES ONLY IN THE AREA WHERE THEY ARE
PROVIDED. Solid reagents for this course will be set out on shelves at
the front of the room, and occasionally in the hood. Corrosive liquid
reagents will be in the hood or on trays.
2. Take no more of the reagent than you need.
3. If by accident you take an excess amount of reagent, share it with a fellow student or dispose of the excess in the appropriate chemical waste
container. NEVER POUR ANYTHING BACK INTO A REAGENT
BOTTLE.
4. No chemicals may be taken out of the laboratory.
5. Cleaning of glasswareâ€”Rinse all glassware used for organic compounds
with a small amount of acetone into the appropriate waste container in
your hood. Discard this organic waste in the appropriate waste
containers.
6. Always dispose of chemicals properly in the designated containers or
according to instructions.
	- Pour organic liquids (e.g., dichloromethane, diethyl ether, petroleum ether, etc.) into the designated organic waste containers.
	- Dispose of solids in the Solid Waste container, and throw paper refuse in the lab wastebaskets.

##### H. Use, Care and Replacement of Laboratory Equipment
1. Water tends to rust equipment and also to cause drawers to swell so that
they cannot be opened without great difficulty. Consequently, if you spill
water in a drawer, immediately take time to dry it carefully. Also, do not
store sponges in your drawer.
2. Separatory funnels, distillation columns, and thermometers are very
expensive. They should always be put away clean and with stoppers out.
3. The lab fee covers normal breakage. However, certain pieces of
apparatus are expensive, and excess breakage will be billed to you.
