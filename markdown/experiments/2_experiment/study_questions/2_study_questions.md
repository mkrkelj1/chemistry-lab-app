#### Study Questions
1. Given the solubility results shown in the table below, choose the most suitable solvent or solvent pair for recrystallizing each compound.  Neither water nor ethanol is miscible with ligroine (mixed hexanes), and water does not mix with toluene.

**Solubility Data**

this table needs so much help

Compound | Water | ethanol | toluene | ligroine
-------- | cold | hot | cold | hot  cold | hot | cold | hot 
G | - | + | - | ++ | ++ | +++ | ++ | ++ 
H | +++ | +++ | +++ | +++ | +++ | +++ | - | - 
I | - | - | +++ | +++ | ++ | ++ | + | +
J | - | - | - | - | + | +++ | +++ | +++

Please keep your answers to the following questions brief.
2. If extracted crude trimyristin were a white crystalline solid, should Norite be used in the recrystallization? Explain.
3. Why is some trimyristin lost each time it is washed with fresh cold solvent while in the Büchner funnel?
4. If the melting point of purified trimyristin was determined before the sample was completely dry, what errors would most likely result? Explain.
5. Naphthalene is an aromatic hydrocarbon with m.p. = 80 °C. Is toluene likely to be a good solvent for recrystallization of naphthalene? (Hint: Find the structure of naphthalene, and the structure and boiling point of toluene.)
