#### Theoretical Definition of Melting Point
Nutmeg powder is a mixture of many essential oils and oleoresins. In this experiment, you will extract trimyristin from nutmeg powder and recrystallize trimyristin. 

#### Choice of a suitable solvent:

**a.** The desired compound should be very soluble in the hot solvent.

**b.** The desired compound is very insoluble in the cold solvent.

**c.** The solvent should be easily removable (fairly volatile) from the desired product.

#### Choice of a solvent pair:
Sometimes no single solvent can fill the requirements of suitability. In such cases, two miscible solvents (solvent pair) can be combined to produce a suitable solvent. Criteria for solvents in a solvent pair are:

**a.** The desired compound will be relatively soluble in solvent #1 even when the solvent is cold.

**b.** The compound will be relatively insoluble in solvent #2 even when the solvent is hot.

**c.** Solvent #1 and solvent #2 must be miscible.

#### Solubility
The theory of solubility is simplistically described by the phrase “*like dissolves like*,” i.e., solutes tend to dissolve in solvents of similar, or like, polarity. Some commonly used solvents for recrystallization are pentane, hexane, toluene, ethyl acetate, ethanol, methanol, and water.

In this experiment, we will use acetone, diethyl ether, toluene, methanol, and water as solvents. Of these solvents, toluene is the least polar, and water is the most polar. The normal procedure for the purification of a compound by recrystallization is to predict its solubility on the basis of its structure and then to test its solubility in a variety of solvents. Once a suitable solvent is found, that compound can be recrystallized.

#### Theory of Extraction
The transfer of a solute from one phase to another is a very common technique in organic chemistry. It is called extraction, and it is also a common technique in everyday life. When you steep a tea bag in boiling water, add a bay leaf to a pot of soup, or wash a load of laundry, you are performing a solid/liquid extraction, in which a solution containing several components is mixed with a second, immiscible liquid, for the purpose of extracting one component of the solution into the second solvent.
