1. According to your Rf values, which compound, dimethyl fumarate or dimethyl maleate, is more polar? Does the structure support this argument? Explain.
2. Which of the two isomers, cis or trans form (dimethyl maleate or dimethyl fumarate), is more stable? Why?
3. Suggest another experimental method to identify dimethyl fumarate. How would this method indicate the purity of the product?
