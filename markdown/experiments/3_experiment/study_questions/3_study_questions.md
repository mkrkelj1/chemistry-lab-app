#### Theoretical Definition of Melting Point
1. The Rf values of three compounds on TLC plates developed with 10:1 hexane-acetone are (A) 0.33, (B) 0.91, and (C) 0.54.
**a.** What would be the order of elution from an alumina column which is eluted with 10:1 hexane-acetone (i.e., which would elute first, second, and third)?
**b.** Explain your reasoning.
**c.** What difference if any would be seen if the compounds were eluted from the column with 7:1 hexane-acetone? Explain.
