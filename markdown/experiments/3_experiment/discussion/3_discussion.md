#### Discussion
Looking at the chemical structures of ferrocene and acetylferrocene, predict the polar nature of these compounds. Which compound do you think is more polar?

Discuss whether your results agree with theory and predictions. Be sure to discuss any problems you had or irregularities in your results. 
Include all values of results that you mention, including the Rf values. 
Please include answers to the following in your discussion.

With reference to your experiment,
**a.** Which of your fractions contained ferrocene?  Which contained acetyl ferrocene?  Explain, using your data.
**b.** Did you isolate pure samples of ferrocene and acetyl ferrocene? What is your evidence?
**c.** Which of the two compounds is more polar?  Explain. (Give evidence from this experiment and from the structures.)
