#### Results
1. Calculate Rf values for all spots and record in a table in your notebook. 
2. Identify each spot.
3. Find the weight of solid recovered from each fraction (ferrocene and acetylferrocene).
4. Calculate the total % recovery. 
Total % recovery = % ferrocene + % acetyl ferrocene
Sample calculation:
% Ferrocene = (weight of ferrocene / weight of starting mixture) x 100
