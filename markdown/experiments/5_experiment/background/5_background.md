#### Theoretical Background
**1. Theory of Extraction**
The transfer of a solute from one phase to another is a very common technique in organic chemistry. It is called extraction, and it is also a common technique in everyday life. When you steep a tea bag in boiling water, add a bay leaf to a pot of soup, or wash a load of laundry, you are performing a solid/liquid extraction, in which a solution containing several components is mixed with a second, immiscible liquid, for the purpose of extracting one component of the solution into the second solvent.

We have seen that recrystallization is used to purify solids that are contaminated by relatively small amounts of impurities. By contrast, the technique of extraction is a more “coarse” or preliminary technique, in that it can be used to separate one compound from another or from large amounts of impurities.

Most *uncharged* organic molecules are more soluble in organic solvents than in water. If the organic solvent itself is not very soluble in water, then when the solvent or one of its solutions is mixed with water, two layers will form, and the solvents are said to be *immiscible*. The layers are called the *organic layer* and the *aqueous layer*. If the two layers are shaken together, small amounts of the components of the organic layer will dissolve in (or be extracted into) the aqueous layer, and small amounts of the aqueous layer components will dissolve (be extracted into) the organic layer, establishing equilibrium between the two layers. Thus, if a neutral compound C is initially dissolved in one layer (phase), it will be distributed, or “partitioned,” between the two layers at equilibrium. The distribution is expressed quantitatively in terms of the coefficient, **K**. Ideally, the distribution coefficient of compound C is equal to the ratio of the individual solubilities of C in pure solvent, **S**, and in pure water, **W**.

[equation]

For extraction of solute from solvent A into solvent B with a given volume of solvent B, several extractions each with small portions of solvent B are more efficient than a single extraction with the total volume of solvent B.

If several different solutes (P, Q, R) are dissolved in an organic solvent,then shaking the solution with water will extract small amounts of each into the aqueous layer, but not allow for a clean separation of any one compound.

However, if during the shaking we can run a reaction which converts one of the solutes, P, into a product which is more soluble in water than in the organic solvent (i.e., by converting it into a charged ionic species, such as a conjugate base or conjugate acid), the product will dissolve extensively in the aqueous layer and thus can be separated from the other organic solutes.

Now, if the reaction can be reversed in the separated aqueous layer, we can recover the original compound, P, separated from the other solutes, Q, and R.  Such a procedure is possible when the mixture contains an organic acid (and/or base) that can be selectively converted to charged products (salts).
