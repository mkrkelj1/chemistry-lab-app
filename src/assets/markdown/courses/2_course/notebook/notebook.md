**The Laboratory Notebook**
===========================

**[Link to download Sample Notebook page](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oZ3xBqEYaeRsx-uyCPSBIkLrmqK6i9N2/view?usp=sharing)**

In your laboratory notebook, you will record information vital to planning and carrying out experiments. The notebook will serve as a permanent record of your work in the laboratory and will be crucial in the preparation of your final lab reports. The laboratory notebook should be permanently bound, with consecutively numbered pages. A laboratory notebook works well for this purpose.

Record information in the lab notebook in ballpoint ink only. Ink because it is permanent, ballpoint because it will not run too badly when you spill solvents on your notebook. For each chemical transformation, start a new page in the notebook. In laboratory exercises that involve more than one reaction (e.g., Ferrocene synthesis experiment), **use a separate page to set up and record each step**. If you need to delete information, strike it with a single line, leaving the original writing legible.

The lab notebook allows you to plan your experiments and to record concisely your experimental procedures and results. You will usually be able to use just one notebook page per reaction. Always start each new reaction on a fresh page, even if there is room remaining on the preceding page.

There is a specific format you will follow in keeping your notebook. Also refer to pages 23-38 in reference **Zubrick, J. W ‘_The Organic Chemistry Lab Survival Manual'_, 9th edition, 2014**. Note and emulate the following important features.

1.  References: They are listed at the top of the page. Give the citation for the source(s) of the experimental procedure you are following.
2.  Always include the Dates that the work was done.
3.  Reaction Scheme and Data Table: You must complete this part before you arrive in the lab. Reactants, reagents, solvents, and products are clearly and neatly depicted. Under the scheme appears a table of data that will guide you as you set up the reaction: (1) molecular formula, (2) molecular weight, (3) mass to be used, in grams, (4) millimoles to be used (1000 mmol = 1 mol), (5) molar equivalents to be used, (6) if you plan to measure the material by volume, the volume, in mL, (7) if the material is a liquid, the density, in g/mL, (8) the source of the material. For the product, give the theoretical yield in molar equiv, mmol, and grams. For solvents, it is only necessary to note the volume to be used. (Please refer to **pages 42-50** in the lab manual for all calculations viz., moles, equivalents etc.)

Once you have tabulated this data, you will have ready access to the information you need to set up and run your reaction. **You will not be admitted to the laboratory without a properly configured notebook page.**

4.  Experimental Procedure: This is written as you carry out the reaction. Write in the passive voice, be clear, and be concise. Give the amounts of reagents, which you actually use, since usually you will not measure out _exactly_ the amounts that you had planned. You do not need to describe routine techniques in detail. For example, you can simply say that the reaction mixture was extracted with diethyl ether, rather than explaining exactly how you did the extraction. Assume that your reader is a competent organic chemist who knows the standard techniques. Be sure to note the appearance of your final product.
5.  Characterization: Indicate the methods used to characterize the product (e.g., NMR, IR). You should not interpret your spectra in detail here. If you measure a melting point, boiling point, optical rotation, or other similar data, record it in the notebook and give the corresponding literature value, if known. **Always note down the name and model of the instrument in your notebook.**Also, always include the reference code for the spectroscopic and physical data. **The format for this course is your initials–book number-page number where the compound was first isolated (e.g., MTB-I-20; it is preferable to include your middle initial).**
6.  Conclusion: Write one-sentence comment on whether or not you obtained the desired product. If not, but you identified some other product, tell what that other product is.
7.  Yield and % Yield: Record the yield of the product. You will find it convenient to record a tare weight for a vial or flask, then place your product in that container and determine the mass by difference. Convert the mass of product to a percent yield, rounded to the nearest percent.

**The Experimental Write-Up (Report)**
======================================

**[Link to download Sample Report](./Sample Report.pdf)**

1.  All reports should be uploaded to Canvas under the appropriate heading in the Assignments section. Use only the pdf, doc, or docx file formats for your reports.
2.  Experiment title, your name, your section, and the date. Fairly self-explanatory.
3.  The **Abstract** is a very brief (typically one- or two-sentence) summary of what you accomplished in the lab.
4.  In the **Discussion** section, provide a bit of background on your motivation for undertaking the experiment. Also provide some details on how well the reaction worked, and discuss mechanistic issues if you think it appropriate. If you wish to give an overview of how you made structural assignments, this is a good place to do it. However, you do not need to get into all the gory details; just provide the highlights. A paragraph or two is usually enough for the entire Discussion section. Often you will want to include structures in your discussion. Learn how to create these using the ChemDraw software package, available on any of the PCs in 6th floor Altschul computer room. Additionally, you can download the software on your personal computer from Columbia library via this link ([https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/10574709?counter=1](https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/10574709?counter=1)). You can copy-and-paste ChemDraw structures into your Word document.
5.  State the main **Conclusions** you reached as a result of completing the experiment. Were you successful in synthesizing the desired compound? If there was some other objective to the laboratory, was it achieved? A couple of sentences ought to do it for the Conclusions section.
6.  The **Experimental Section** provides the exact recipes for the chemistry you did, allowing the reader to reproduce your results in the lab if she so desires. First there is a General section that describes instrumentation and procedures used in acquiring characterization data. Following that are the actual experimental procedures, taken from the laboratory notebook. These are written in the passive voice and include amounts of all reactants. At the end of the procedure is a tabulation of the characterization data. Be sure to follow exactly the format given in the sample write-up. In some cases you will have other characterization data besides the type included in the template; be sure to consult with an instructor on how to report that information properly.
7.  Under **Supporting Information**, provide a list of the items that you are handing in with the lab report. Typically, this supplementary material will include most of the following:

Copies of laboratory notebook pages: Duplicate page(s) is (are) collected at the end of each lab session, duly signed by one of your instructors.

Spectra with assignments: Draw a careful structure on each spectrum and clearly assign spectral lines to the corresponding structural features in the molecule. We have provided examples of labeled 1H and 13C NMR spectra for the product described in the sample lab write-up.

**Synthetic product****: Provide your product in a properly labeled vial. Include the following on the label: reference code (JJV-I-08), date, section, mass, compound structure. Lastly, cover the label with clear tape to avoid smudging.**

8.  In the **References** section list, using the proper format, any sources cited in your laboratory report. For proper formatting of references consult a recent issue of any American Chemical Society (ACS) journal, such as _Journal of the American Chemical Society_, _The__Journal of Organic Chemistry_, _Organic Letters_, or _Organometallics_. Be selective in citing references; some lab reports will not contain any references. Finally, be sure to cite any electronic resources you use; do not neglect these.

All the reports should be uploaded under Assignments on Canvas by the deadline.
