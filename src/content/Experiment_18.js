    <h1>Synthesis of Ferrocene and Acetylferrocene</h1>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Ferrocene, first prepared in 1951, is an organometallic
      &ldquo;sandwich&rdquo; compound. The molecule contains an iron(II) center,
      sandwiched between two organic fragments. The metal center is equally
      bonded to each of the 10 carbons of the planar cyclopentadienyl rings, and
      the resulting bright orange compound is remarkably stable to water and
      heat. Ferrocene is quite non-polar (<em>R</em>
      <sub>
        <em>f</em>
      </sub>{" "}
      &asymp; 1 in TLC experiments using hexanes to elute a sample on a SiO
      <sub>2</sub>-coated TLC plate). Its cyclopentadienyl anion is prepared by
      deprotonation of cyclopentadiene, using potassium hydroxide as the base in
      diethyl ether solvent. Cyclopentadiene readily dimerizes to
      dicyclopentadiene and must be freshly prepared by thermal cracking of the
      dimer. The cracking process involves a retro Diels-Alder reaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Critical to an understanding of the ferrocene synthesis is an appreciation
      for the aromatic character of the cyclopentadienyl anion. The p<em>K</em>a
      of a cyclopentadiene methylene (-CH<sub>2</sub>-) hydrogen suggests that
      the conjugate base, cyclopentadienyl anion, is very stable relative to the
      anions derived from other hydrocarbons. The p<em>K</em>a of
      cyclopentadiene is around 16, roughly equal to that of water. Compare this
      value to that for the much less acidic allylic hydrogen of cyclohexadiene
      (Figure 1).
    </p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="./image9.png"
        alt="Figure 1: Relative acidities of cyclopentadiene and cyclohexadiene"
        width="90%"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      The pKa data indicate that it is relatively easy to form the
      cyclopentadienyl anion. It is much more stable than the corresponding
      cyclohexadienyl anion. The more stable cyclopentadienyl anion is planar,
      with all carbons sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized and a continuous, cyclic array
      of five 2p orbitals aligned perpendicular to the molecular plane (Figure
      2). Six (4n+2, with n=1) ùúã-electrons are delocalized over this cyclic
      array, satisfying the H&uuml;ckel condition for aromaticity. The aromatic
      character of the cyclopentadienyl anion renders it quite stable relative
      to other carbanions. It is stable enough that it forms readily upon
      exposure of cyclopentadiene to potassium hydroxide in diethyl ether.
      Formation of the anion is evident from its pink color in this solvent.
    </p>

      <img

        alt="Figure 2: The pi-system of the cyclopentadienyl anion comprises a cyclic array of five 2p orbitals"
        width="90%"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyclopentadienyl anion is stable, for a carbanion-but it is still readily
      deprotonated upon exposure to moisture. Moreover, FeCl<sub>2</sub>&bull;H
      <sub>2</sub>O is readily oxidized by atmospheric oxygen. Therefore, you
      will have to conduct the ferrocene synthesis in dry glassware and under an
      atmosphere of nitrogen. Many reactions in organic chemistry are moisture-
      or air-sensitive or both. The ability to work under anhydrous conditions
      and under an inert atmosphere is a vital skill for the practicing organic
      chemist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Complexation with iron(II) stabilizes the cyclopentadienyl anion, as the
      organic fragment shares its six ùúã-electrons with the metal center. The
      valence electron count at the iron(II) center in ferrocene becomes 12 from
      the two cyclopentadienyl ligands, plus 6 from the metal itself, for a
      total of 18 electrons. This is a particularly stable electronic
      configuration for the metal, representing frilled 4s, 3d, and 4p shells
      (Krypton-like). The &ldquo;18-electron rule&rdquo; for transition metals
      is analogous to the more familiar octet rule for the main group elements.

    </p>
    <p>
      The cyclopentadienyl rings in ferrocene retain their aromatic character.
      You will explore their reactivity in an electrophilic aromatic
      substitution reaction as you prepare acetylferrocene (Figure 3). The
      acetylated material is more polar and darker-colored than the starting
      ferrocene. Column chromatography is well suited for separating the
      acetylferrocene product from an unreacted ferrocene. You will be able to
      monitor elution of the colored ferrocene and acetylferrocene bands from
      the chromatography column visually. You will characterize both ferrocene
      and acetylferrocene by MP determination and NMR spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>
      H and <sup>13</sup>C).

                authentic samples of ferrocene and acetylferrocene in a 30:1
                Toluene-Absolute Ethanol solvent. The crude is chromatographed
                on basic alumina activity I, eluting first with hexanes, then

                Crude as well as standard samples of compounds are dissolved in
                methylene chloride before spotting. Methylene chloride is
                suspected of causing cancer. You use hexanes and ethyl acetate
                as eluents for column chromatography. Developer for TLC is a

                Avoid exposure and inhalation of all solvents. Silica gel causes
                respiratory irritation as they are very fine particles.
                Sometimes it may cause skin irritation. Wear gloves while
                transferring silica gel on to the column. Avoid inhalation and
                contact of silica gel particles as well.
