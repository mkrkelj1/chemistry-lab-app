<li>Prepare a Table of Physical Constants for the following compounds: bromobenzene, diethyl ether, biphenyl, benzoic acid, phenol, and magnesium. Include molecular weights, formulae, and (except for Mg) structures, and other relevant properties. 
Include in your Table the structures and melting points of the following compounds: diphenylmethanol (benzhydrol), 1,1-diphenylethanol, triphenylmethanol (triphenylcarbinol), and 1-phenylcyclohexanol.</li>
<li>Predict the 1H NMR pattern (approximate chemical shifts and multiplicities) for all of these above compounds (diphenylmethanol -- 1-phenylcyclohexanol). </li>
<li>An unknown alcohol had a melting point of 63-66° C. The chromic acid test gave a green precipitate. The literature value for the melting point of diphenylmethanol is 69° C, while the literature melting point of 1-phenylcyclohexanol is 63° C. Which of these compounds is most likely to be the unknown alcohol? Explain your answer. </li>
</ol>
