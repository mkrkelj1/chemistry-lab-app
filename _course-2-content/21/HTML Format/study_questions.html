<li>Write a reasonable mechanism for the Grignard Reaction. </li>
<li>There are two possible sites on 1-bromo-4-fluorobenzene for insertion of the Mg atom into a C-X bond, and thus two different Grignard reagents that could be formed. </li>
<br><blockquote>a) Draw each of the possible Grignard reagents.</br></blockquote>
