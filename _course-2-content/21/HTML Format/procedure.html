<p>1. The <em>day before </em>your laboratory session place the following items in a 110&deg; C drying oven: 250 mL beaker (labeled with your initials) containing about 25 pieces of magnesium turnings, 2 small vials, a condenser, and a 50 mL (or a 25 mL) 2-neck or 3-neck RBF</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>2. Remove the glassware from oven and immediately cap the vials. Put a magnetic stir bar in the RBF. Cool under nitrogen.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Handle glassware with care. You must wear oven mitts to remove hot RBF from the oven. Hot glassware can cause burns. Remove the oven mitts after you insert the stir bar into the RBF, clamped onto a ring stand and cover the RBF&rsquo;s using septum. Nitrogen lines have needles. While inserting nitrogen lines and vent needles on to the septa, be careful not to poke your skin.</p>
</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p>3. As soon as possible, take the beaker containing the Mg to a balance. Weight about 12 millimoles of Mg. Use forceps to handle the Mg. (If the traffic is too heavy, do step 4 first.) Put the Mg on a weighing paper. Transfer the Mg to the RBF and continue to flush with nitrogen. Record the exact weight of Mg.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>4. Fill one vial with about 20 mL of ANHYDROUS ether from the container in the hood and immediately cover the vial with a septum. This should be more than enough for the entire experiment. KEEP THE VIAL CAPPED with the septum, and use the DRY 1 mL syringe in the microscale kit exclusively for measuring portions of this ether.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Needle (18G) attached to a syringe of appropriate volume is used for transferring ether. Follow the instructions correctly as given to you for transferring air sensitive reagents/solvents. Be careful not to poke yourself while using needles. The plunger of syringes may malfunction and leakage can happen.</p>
<p>Inhalation of ether vapors and contact should be avoided.</p>
</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p>5. Add 3 mL of anhydrous ether to the RBF.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>6. Calculate the number of moles of Mg actually used (atomic weight of Mg = 24.31 g/mole) and the equivalent number of grams of bromobenzene (MW = 157.02 g/mole). This should amount to 6.46 x (wt. of Mg), since grams PhBr = (157.02 / 24.31) x (g of Mg used) for equilimolar amounts. (The abbreviation PhBr will be used for bromobenzene = phenyl bromide).</p>
</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p>7. Weigh the calculated amount of dry bromobenzene in the second oven-dried vial. Add 4.2 mL of anhydrous ether, cover the vial with a septum, and reattach the nitrogen.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Take care when handling bromobenzene. Can cause skin irritation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>8. Take 1.2 mL of PhBr-ether solution in a 5 mL syringe, and add it to the RBF. Disconnect the nitrogen. With a DRY 6 mm stirring rod, crush the magnesium by pressing and twisting the rod with the bottom of the RBF resting on the bench top. (Try not to insert the grass rod through the bottom of the RBF or the palm of your hand.) Initiation of the reaction is indicated by a slight cloudiness in the solution and by bubbles on the surface of the Mg. As soon as the reaction starts, reconnect the nitrogen, and connect the RBF to the condenser. Begin stirring.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Handle glassware with care.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>9. Take the remaining PhBr-ether solution in the same 5 mL syringe. Insert the needle of this syringe through the septum. Add the solution to the RBF dropwise over a period of about 10 minutes. (<em>In video, a dropping funnel is used instead of a syringe to add PhBr-ether dropwise). </em>Adjust the rate of addition to maintain a gentle reflux of the ether. If the reaction becomes too vigorous, cool the bottom of the RBF in a beaker of room temperature water. When the spontaneous boiling of the mixture becomes slow, immerse the bottom of the RBF in a beaker of warm water (about 40&deg; C), and reflux the mixture gently until nearly all of the Mg has disintegrated or no further change is seen (about 15 min). The solution of phenyl magnesium bromide should look brownish and may be slightly cloudy. If the volume of solution has decreased to less than about half the volume of the RBF, add enough anhydrous ether (with your either syringe through the vent needle) to bring the volume back to about half the RBF. Allow the solution to cool to room temperature.</p>

<p>Handle glassware with care. Glassware can break and can cause injury. Make sure cooling water inlet and outlet are securely fastened onto the condenser.</p>

<tr>
<td>
<p>1. Rinse the syringe used for addition of the PhBr with about 0.5 mL of anhydrous ether. (Squirt the ether into the vial used for mixing the PhBr and cap it for later disposal.)</p>
</td>

<p>Inhalation of ether vapours and contact should be avoided.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>2. Remove all of the unknown solution from the vial with the syringe and add it dropwise to the Grignard solution, as before, at such a rate that GENTLE reflux is maintained. The reaction is very exothermic. The reaction can be controlled, if necessary, by cooling the RBF in a beaker of water (room temperature). It is very important to mix the solution thoroughly by stirring well after each drop is added. After the addition of a few drops, a precipitate may form that makes mixing very inefficient. Some of the carbonyl compounds produce heavy precipitates that make mixing difficult.</p>

<p>Take care with this exothermic reaction. If necessary, control by cooling in a beaker of water.</p>

<p>1. At the end of the 15-minute reflux, cool the RBF in ice water. Then pour the entire contents into a large test tube. Cool the test tube in ice water. Rinse the RBF with three 3 mL portions of 25% NH4Cl. Transfer as much solid as possible to the large test tube with each rinse. Then rinse with 3 mL of ether. (Technical ether may be used for this and all following procedures.) If solid material persists in the mixture, stir and add 1.0 mL portions of 25% NH4Cl or ether (whichever has the greatest effect) until the solid dissolves. The product is in the ether layer. Ignore any solid Mg and/or cloudiness in the bottom aqueous layer.</p>

<p>2. Separate the layers by removing the lower layer with a Pasteur pipet held firmly against the test tube bottom. Fit the centrifuge tube from the microscale kil with a funnel, and decant the ether solution of reaction products into this centrifuge tube, leaving any remaining Mg in the large test tube.</p>

<p>3. Extract the ether layer with 3 mL of saturated sodium bisulfite solution. Separate the layers with a Pasteur pipet, and then extract with 6 mL of 10% sodium bicarbonate solution. Separate again, and finally extract with 3 mL of saturated sodium chloride solution. Separate the layers cleanly at this point.</p>

<p><strong>Recrystallization</strong></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>1. Test the solubility of a spatula-tip full of crude produce in hot and cold ligroine. If ligroine is not a suitable solvent for recrystallization, then try ethanol. If neither is suitable for recrystallization, try a mixed solvent of ethanol-water. A mixed solvent recrystallization is done as follows:</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Add a few drops of the good solvent (ethanol) to the solid. Heat to boiling. Add more solvent until the solid dissolves.</li>
<li>Add drops of poor solvent (water) to the hot solution (stir), until a slight cloudiness persists.</li>
<li>Add drops of good solvent until the boiling solution becomes clear.</li>
<li>Cool and filter as usual.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>As a last resort, a mixed solvent of ethyl acetate (good) and ligroine might be examined. Summarize the results of your solubility tests in tabular form in your notebook.</p>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>2. Set aside enough of the crude product for a melting point and to use for seed crystals in case your alcohol product is not easy to crystallize. Recrystallize the remainder from the most suitable solvent. Allow plenty of time for complete crystallization in the ice-cold solvent, since some of the alcohol products crystallize very slowly.</p>
</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p>3. Collect the purified product by vacuum filtration with the microscale kit filter flask and Hirsch funnel. (Remember to clamp the flask.) Wash the product with ice-cold solvent. Spread the crystals on a filter paper. Crush any large lumps with a spatula to hasten the drying process.</p>
