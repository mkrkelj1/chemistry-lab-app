<li>Identification and Calculations</li>
<br><blockquote>a. Identify your product based on its melting point and the NMR results.
<br>b. Identify the ketone or aldehyde that must have been in the original unknown solution.
<br>c. Calculate the theoretical yield of your product, the percent yield of crude product, and the percent yield of purified product. (Assume that magnesium is the limiting reagent.) Show work for your calculations. Prepare a yield table showing the weight used, molecular weight, and the number of moles for each substance used in the reaction.</br></blockquote>
<li>Write a lab report in the proper format including observations from the video. </li>
<li>After watching the video (the synthesis of Grignard reagent), suggest two improved safety measures that the video did not mention or practice.</li>
<li>Go through the procedure and note all the waste you will produce and which of the waste disposal locations (halogenated waste, non-halogenated waste, solid waste, trash bin, glass/sharps) you would put them in.</li>
