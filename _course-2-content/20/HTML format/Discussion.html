<p><em>Note</em>: This is Post-lab Assignment</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: <strong>Carbonyl Chemistry Lab has two parts: Aldol Reaction and Keto-Enol Equilibrium Study</strong></p>
<h1>Part I - Post-lab Assignment - Aldol Reaction</h1>
<ol>
<li>Using data given in video, write a lab report in the normal format. You must include procedure and observations from video written as if in the lab.</li>
<li>After watching the video, suggest two improved safety measures that the video did not mention or practice. 
</li>
<li>Go through the procedure and note all the waste you will produce and which of the waste disposal locations (halogenated waste, non-halogenated waste, solid waste, trash bin, glass/sharps) you would put them in.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Part II - Post-lab Assignment - Keto - Enol Equilibrium</h1>
<p><strong>Problem Set</strong></p>
<p><em>Part 1:</em></p>
<p>Thermo Fisher Scientific published a paper showcasing the use of NMR in measuring chemical equilibrium. Figure 2 shows the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of ethyl acetoacetate measured from a neat sample at 82 MHz and 32 &deg;C.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The peaks have already been identified to their respective H atoms in either the keto or enol form of the molecule. The integration values for selected peaks are given in Table 1. Use those measurements to calculate two values for K<sub>eq</sub>. How do these values compare to each other?</p>

<p>Imagine you start with 1 mol of the keto-form of ethyl acetoacetate. How many moles of the keto and enol will there be at equilibrium at 32 &deg;C? What if 0.03 moles of Br<sub>2</sub> (aq) are added and reacted with the enol form to completion (as in the video)? How many moles of the enol and keto form will there be at the new equilibrium?</p>
<p><em>Part 2:</em></p>
<p><sup>1</sup>H NMR can also highlight how the keto-enol equilibrium position is dependent on the solvent. The <sup>1</sup>H NMR of dimedone (Figure 3) was done in both CDCl<sub>3</sub> and CDCl<sub>3</sub> with a few drops of DMSO-d<sub>6</sub>. The <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra for both solvent conditions with the integration values for peaks shown below the x-axis are linked in Table 2.</p>

<p>Identify which hydrogens each peak represents and then calculate the K<sub>eq</sub> values for both solvent conditions. Compare the K<sub>eq</sub> values for both conditions and explain why the equilibrium is different between the two solvent conditions.</p>
