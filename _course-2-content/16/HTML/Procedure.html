<td>
<p>1. In an oven-dried RBF, glacial acetic acid (40 mL) is added to acetanilide (34g).</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Wear goggles, gloves and lab-coat. Handle glassware with care. Glassware can break and can cause injury. Glacial Acetic acid is corrosive. You must wear gloves while dispensing acid.</p>
</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p>2. The reaction flask is heated to about 65 ℃. After the acetanilide is fully dissolved, the reaction mixture is cooled to 50 ℃</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Hot plate used for heating is HOT. Wear oven mitts while handling hot plates as they can cause burns. If you have an injury or burn, immediately notify your instructors.</p>
</td>

<p>3. Ice cold concentrated sulfuric acid (50 mL) is carefully and slowly added to the reaction flask. The reaction flask is placed in an ice bath and cooled to 5 ℃.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Concentrated sulfuric acid is <strong>very corrosive. </strong>Concentrated sulfuric acid can cause severe burns including damage to eyes. Wear thick gloves while handling. If you have contact with it, wash immediately and thoroughly with cold running water. Notify the instructors while you continue to wash.</p>

<p><strong>It is very important that you add conc. Sulfuric acid to conc. Nitric acid</strong></p>
<p>If you have contact with it, wash immediately and thoroughly with cold running water. Notify the instructors while you continue to wash.</p>
<p>If you spill acid on the counter, notify the instructor immediately</p>

<p>5. Once ice cold, add the nitrating solution slowly to the reaction flask via pipette.&nbsp;</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The acid mixture is very corrosive. You must wear thick gloves and goggles adding the nitration mixture.</p>

<td>
<p>6. After stirring for 40 minutes, the reaction flask is added to the 100 mL of ice water. The desired intermediate is isolated via filtration.</p>

<p>10. Ice-cold concentrated ammonium hydroxide solution (100 mL) is added to the reaction flask.&nbsp;</p>
</td>

<p>12. The crude product is dissolved in hot ethanol (150 mL) and allowed to cool to room temperature. After being cooled to room temperature. The beaker is placed in an ice bath.</p>
</td>

<p>Avoid exposure and inhalation of all solvents. Use oven mitts when handling hot solvent and hot plates.</p>
</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p>13. The precipitate is collected via vacuum filtration, and washed with a couple portions of cold ethanol. The purity of the product is checked via melting point and thin layer chromatography (TLC).</p>

<td>
<p>14. A small amount (&lt; 5 mg) of the product is dissolved in methylene chloride and compared by TLC to authentic samples of <em>o</em>- and <em>p</em>-nitroaniline, using 1:1 EtoOAc-hexanes as the developer. If necessary, the material is further purified by a second recrystallization.&nbsp;</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Methylene chloride is suspected of causing cancer. Avoid exposure and inhalation of all solvents. <em>p-</em>nitroaniline is toxic if swallowed, in contact with skin or inhaled.</p>
