<p>1. Place 0.0132 mole of your assigned camphor in a 50 mL round-bottom flask (RBF). Add 8 mL of methanol and cool the flask in a 250 mL beaker ice bath. While the flask is cooling, weigh 0.016 mole of NaBH<sub>4</sub> in a vial and keep it covered. Crush any large lumps with a spatula.</p>

<p>Wear goggles, gloves and lab-coat. Handle glassware with care. Glassware can break and can cause injury.Glacial Acetic acid is corrosive. You must wear gloves while dispensing acid.</p>

<p>2. Add the NaBH<sub>4</sub> to the camphor solution in 3 portions with cooling, as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the flask from the ice bath and add about 2 scoopula-tips full of NaBH<sub>4</sub>. Swirl the mixture for 5-6 minutes. Crush any solid lumps that form with a thin bent spatula. Whenever the bubbling becomes vigorous and/or the flask no longer feels cool, return it to the ice bath. Continue to swirl and crush lumps.</li>
<li>After about 6 minutes, cool the flask in the ice bath; repeat step <strong>a.</strong></li>
<li>Repeat step <strong>b</strong>, adding the remaining NaBH<sub>4</sub></li>
</ol>

<p>3. After about 5 minutes, let the solution warm to room temperature. Swirl it occasionally for another 10 minutes. Meanwhile, clamp the flask to a ring stand with the flask in contact with a steam bath (STEAM OFF) and equip it with a reflux condenser. (Cooling water tubing will not be needed for this short reflux time.) When bubbling becomes slow, heat the solution to boiling, and reflux it for about 5 minutes.</p>

<p>4. Add 30 mL of ice into a 125 mL Erlenmeyer flask, cool the reaction mixture for a minute or two, and pour it with stirring onto the ice. Rinse the reaction flask twice with 2 mL portions of methanol and add the washes to the reaction mixture.</p>

<p>5. Stir the mixture until the ice melts. Collect the solid by vacuum filtration. Wash the filtered solid with cold distilled water, and press it dry with a glass stopper.</p>

<p>6. Transfer the crude reaction product to the same 125 mL Erlenmeyer flask. Save a few small crystals of crude product to use as seed crystals, in case the product &ldquo;oils out&rdquo; as the recrystallization solution cools.</p>
</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p>7. Dissolve the crude product in a minimum volume of <strong>hot</strong> 1:1 methanol-water mixture. (The flask containing the solvent and the flask containing the crude product should be on the steam bath). Then add <strong>cold </strong>water dropwise until a permanent turbidity is seen. Add <strong>hot </strong>methanol again until the solution just becomes clear. Set aside slowly to cool. Then cool in ice, and filter the recrystallized product using suction filtration. Use two pieces of filter paper.</p>

<p><strong>Functional Group Tests</strong></p>
<p>Two classical tests will be performed in order to determine whether or not the product is an alcohol and whether or not it is contaminated by unreacted camphor. <strong>For a and b below, record your observations and results in tabular form, and give general equations for positive test results.</strong></p>

<p><strong>a. Chromic Acid Test for Alcohols </strong><br />In the chromic acid test, 1&deg; and 2&deg; alcohols are oxidized by solutions of chromic acid (H2CrO4) to form carboxylic acids and ketones, respectively; tertiary alcohols do not react with H2CrO4. A positive test is indicated by the formation of a green-blue precipitate. <br />Add a match head size of solid or 1 drop of liquid to 1 mL acetone in a test tube. Then add 1 drop chromic acid reagent and shake the mixture. The appearance of an opaque blue-green color within 2 seconds is a positive test. Perform the test on 1-butanol, 2-butanol, 2-methyl-2-propanol (<em>t</em>-BuOH), camphor, and your product. (<em>In your lab notebook, predict the results for the standard alcohols tested and report in tabular format</em>). <br />Discard all waste from this test in the specially designated container.</p>
<p><strong>b.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>2,4-Dinitrophenylhydrazine (2,4-DNP) Test for Ketones </strong><strong><br /></strong>In the 2,4-DNP test, ketones (and aldehydes) react rapidly with 2,4-DNP to give brightly colored precipitates. Alcohols do not react with this reagent. <br />Different concentrations of reactants will be used to increase the sensitivity of the test, so that small amounts of unreacted starting material (camphor) can be detected in the product from your reduction reaction.</p>
<p><strong>Knowns</strong><br />Perform this test on the following substances: isoborneol, camphor, methanol, and acetone. For each test, put 1 mL of 95% ethanol in a small test tube. Add (and mix) a spatula-tip full or 5 drops of the test compound, followed by 1 mL of 2,4-DNP reagent. Mix well. If a precipitate does not form, boil the solution in the test tube in a steam bath for 1 minute. Cool it in ice. A colored precipitate is a positive test for a ketone.</p>
<p><strong>Reaction product </strong><br />Repeat the 2,4-DNP test as above, but use about 0.1 g of your product. If a positive test is observed, explain why this occurred. <br />Discard all waste from this test in the Non-Halogenated waste container.</p>

<p><strong>Polarimetry</strong></p>

<p>10. Accurately weigh out about 0.2500 g of camphor in a small beaker. Dissolve the camphor in the beaker in a small amount of 95% ethanol. Transfer this solution <strong>quantitatively </strong>to a 25 mL volumetric flask and fill to the mark with 95% ethanol; mix well. Set the polarimeter to zero (0) with a 95% ethanol blank cell. Fill a 1 dm cell with the prepared camphor solution and measure the optical rotation. (About 10 mL of solution is needed).</p>

<p>11. Accurately weigh out about 0.5000 g of your product in a small beaker. Dissolve and transfer quantitatively to a 25 mL volumetric flask and fill to the mark with 95% ethanol, as in step <strong>10 </strong>above. (If the solution is cloudy or turbid, filter it). Be sure to rinse the polarimeter cell with a little ethanol and then pre-rinse it with some of your sample before filling the cell. Measure the optical rotation as above.</p>
