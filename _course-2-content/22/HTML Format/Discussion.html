<li>Calculations (include these answers in your Discussion).</li>
<br><blockquote>a. Does your calculated specific rotation correspond to a single pure alcohol isomer? Which one? If not, determine from the signs of optical rotation of your starting material and product which isomer (if either) was formed in excess and the identity of the other isomer. 
<br>b. Calculate the percent composition  of your product (if it was a mixture).  
Assume that: 
	[ɑ](specific) = Xb[ɑ]b + Xi[ɑ]i 
b = borneal, i = isoborneol expected from your starting material, X = mole fraction 
Was the reaction stereospecific or stereoselective? </br></blockquote>
<li>Write a lab report in the proper format including observations from the video.</li>
<li>Go through the procedure and note all the waste you will produce and which of the waste disposal locations (halogenated waste, non-halogenated waste, solid waste, trash bin, glass/sharps) you would put them in.</li>
</ol>
