<li>Read Jones, Chapter 4, on Stereochemistry.</li>
<li>Prepare a Table of Physical Constants in your notebook. Include structures, formulae, molecular weights, specific rotations, and other relevant physical properties for (+)-camphor, (-)-camphor, (+)-borneol, (-)-borneol, (+)-isoborneol, (-)-isoborneol, methanol, and sodium borohydride. Identify all chiral centers in the compounds listed above and label them as (R) or (S).  Number the carbon atoms in camphor as shown in the equation on the first page of experiment. (Consult the Merck Index and the Aldrich Catalog, in addition to the Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, and if necessary, the Dictionary of Organic Compounds.)</li>
<li>Write a balanced equation for the NaBH4 reduction of camphor, showing all likely products.</li>
<li>Identify the products of this reaction as structural isomers, enantiomers, or diastereomers.</li>
<li>Define the terms “stereoselective” and “stereospecific”.</li>
