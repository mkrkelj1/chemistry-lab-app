<p><strong>Safety Precautions</strong></p>

<tr>
<td>
<p>1.&nbsp;An oven-dried 50 mL RBF and magnetic stir bar is cooled under nitrogen.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Wear goggles, gloves and lab-coat. Handle all glassware with care.</p>
<br />
<p>Use oven mitts to remove hot RBF and magnetic stir bar from the oven. Hot glassware can cause burns. Remove the oven mitts after you insert a stir bar into the RBF, and put it into the desiccator for it to cool down. After it has cooled down, then you clamp the RBF onto the ring stand and cover the RBF using a septum. Nitrogen lines have needles. While inserting nitrogen lines and vent needles on to the septa, be careful not to poke your skin.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;Potassium hydroxide (4.0 g) is freshly ground up and added to the reaction flask.</p>
<br /><br /></td>
<td>
<p>KOH is highly caustic and can cause burns. Wear thick gloves while powdering KOH. Also, KOH is highly hygroscopic. Mortar and pestle are heavy. Handle carefully.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>3.The flask is flushed with nitrogen, and anhydrous diethyl ether (12.0 mL) is added. The suspension is stirred well.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Needle (18G) attached to a syringe of appropriate volume is used for transferring diethyl ether from sure seal bottles. Follow the instructions correctly as given to you (both in the lab manual and technique videos) for transferring air sensitive reagents/solvents. Be careful not to poke yourself while using needles. The plunger of syringes may malfunction and leakage can happen.</p>
</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p>4. Ferrous chloride tetrahydrate (1.3 g) is quickly weighed and transferred to a dry RBF. The flask is then flushed with nitrogen,and anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 10 mL) is added. The mixture is stirred for 10 min.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>See precautions listed as #3 above. FeCl<sub>2</sub>&bull;H<sub>2</sub>O can easily get oxidized. Handle the compound efficiently</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>5. To the stirred KOH suspension, at room temperature, is added freshly distilled cyclopentadiene (1 mL).</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Cyclopentadiene has a very bad odor. <strong>Inhalation of vapors and contact should be avoided.</strong> Transfer of reagent must be done in the fume-hood. Gloves used, to transfer cyclopentadiene must be replaced by a fresh pair before you continue with the experiment.</p>
<p>Used gloves and transfer needles and syringes of all reagents must be placed in the far corner of the fume-hood.</p>
</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p>6. Using a cannula, the Ferrous chloride tetrahydrate solution is transferred to the cyclopentadienyl anion solution. After 30 min, the reaction mixture is poured into an acidic ice slurry (40 mL of 12 M HCl into ice) in a 150 mL beaker.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The cannula has two sharp ends. Be careful not to poke yourself while using cannula. HCl is corrosive and can cause burns. Wear gloves. If you come in contact with acid, wash immediately and thoroughly with cold running water.</p>

<p>7. The resulting precipitate is collected by vacuum filtration, and washed with distilled water.</p>

<td>
<p>Ferrocene sublimes at low temperatures. <strong>Avoid inhalation of ferrocene vapors as they are very harmful.</strong></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>8. The crude ferrocene is purified by column chromatography (silica gel column) using hexanes as the eluent. The purified product is characterized by M.P. determination and <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectroscopy.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Silica gel causes respiratory irritation as they are very fine particles. Sometimes it may cause skin irritation. Wear gloves while transferring silica gel on to the column. Avoid inhalation and contact of silica gel particles as well as hexanes.</p>
<p>NMR tubes are made of fine glass and are easily breakable. Handle NMR tubes gently to avoid injury. CDCl<sub>3</sub> is suspected to cause cancer. Wear gloves while handling all NMR solvents. Avoid exposure and inhalation of these solvent.</p>

<p><strong>Preparation of Acetylferrocene</strong></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>1. To an oven-dried 20 mL RBF, add the purified ferrocene. Be sure to separate and leave out 10 mg of ferrocene for melting point and NMR spectroscopy. According to the amount of ferrocene you add to the reaction flask. Calculate the amount of the subsequent reagents you need.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>You must wear oven mitts to remove hot RBF. Remove the oven mitts after you insert a stir bar into the RBF, and put it into the desiccator for it to cool down. After it has cooled down, then you clamp the RBF onto the ring stand and cover the RBF using a septum. Nitrogen lines have needles. While inserting nitrogen lines and vent needles on to the septa, be careful not to poke your skin.</p>

<td>
<p>2. Add distilled acetic anhydride and 85% phosphoric acid. Reflux the reaction mixture for 20 minutes.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Avoid inhalation and exposure to all reagents. 85% phosphoric acid and acetic anhydride are corrosive. Wear gloves while you handle these reagents in fume-hood.</p>
<br />
<p>Handle glassware with care. Glassware can break and cause injury. The hot plate and oil bath used for reflux are HOT. Wear oven mitts while handling hot oil bats and hot plates. Make sure the cooling water inlet and outlet are securely fastened onto the condenser Spillage of cold water into hot oil bath MUST be avoided at all times. If you have an injury or burn, immediately notify your instructors.</p>

<td>
<p>3. Pour the contents of the reaction flask into a beaker containing ice (1.5 mL). Be sure to scrap out all of the product from the reaction flask.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>4. Neutralize the reaction mixture by adding 5% NaOH dropwise. Collect the precipitate via vacuum filtration.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>NaOH is caustic and causes burns. If you come in contact with NaOH, wash the area immediately and thoroughly with cold running water. Notify your instructor. <strong>Acetylferrocene is fatal, if ingested.</strong> Avoid inhalation and exposure to acetylferrocene</p>
</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p>5. A sample of the cruide is analyzed by TLC, co-spotting with authentic samples of ferrocene and acetylferrocene in a 30:1 Toluene-Absolute Ethanol solvent. The crude is chromatographed on basic alumina activity I, eluting first with hexanes, then 1:10 ethyl acetate-hexanes.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Crude as well as standard samples of compounds are dissolved in methylene chloride before spotting. Methylene chloride is suspected of causing cancer. You use hexanes and ethyl acetate as eluents for column chromatography. Developer for TLC is a mixture of toluene and absolute ethanol.</p>
<p>Avoid exposure and inhalation of all solvents. Silica gel causes respiratory irritation as they are very fine particles. Sometimes it may cause skin irritation. Wear gloves while transferring silica gel on to the column. Avoid inhalation and contact of silica gel particles as well.</p>

<td>
<p>6. The product-containing fraction is concentrated on the rotary evaporator in a tared RBF. It is then placed on the high-vacuum line to remove the last traces of solvent.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The rotovap can be dangerous if you do not follow the instructions and sequences. The instrument is under vacuum, trying to remove glassware from a system under vacuum can be dangerous to yourself and others. Systems under vacuum have the potential to explode if you do not follow correct instructions. Isopropanol used in the cold finger is rubbing alcohol. However, while adding dry ice into the alcohol spillage occurs if you add huge amounts in one addition. Dry ice can cause frostbite. Wear oven mitts while handling dry ice.</p>
