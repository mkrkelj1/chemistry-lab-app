<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">An oven-dried round-bottom flask is obtained. 64 mL of 1-butanol and 50 mL of acetic acid are added to the RBF.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wear goggles, gloves, and lab-coat. Work in fume hood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Handle glass-ware with care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carboxylic acids are corrosive and can cause burns. If you have contact with carboxylic acids, rinse off skin immediately.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concentrated sulfuric acid is </span><strong>very corrosive. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wear thick gloves while handling. If you have contact with it, wash immediately and thoroughly with cold running water. Notify the instructors while you continue to wash.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">A heating mantle is set-up below the RBF. A reflux condenser is placed on the round-bottom flask and reaction mixture refluxed for 3h. After 3h, the RBF is cooled without removing condenser. The condense is removed after the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature.</span></p>
</td>
<td style="height: 74px;">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Handle glass-ware with care. Glassware can break and can cause injury. Hot plate used for reflux is HOT. Wear oven mitts with handling hot plates. HOT hot plate can cause burns. Make sure cooling water inlet and outlet are securely fastened onto the condenser. If you have an injury or burn, immediately notify your instructors.</span></p>

<td style="height: 87px;">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The reaction mixture is transferred into a separatory funnel. The flask is rinsed with distilled waters several times and the rinse is added to the funnel. Water (50 mL) is added to the funnel. The separatory funnel is shaken gently with frequent venting for several minutes. Drain aqueous layer into Erlenmeyer flask and discard. Repeat washing of organic layer with water.</span></p>
</td>
<td style="height: 87px;">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While performing an extraction with a separatory funnel, do not point the stem of the funnel toward anyone, including you. Pressure can build up in the separatory funnel while you shake, the glass stopper can fly off from the top and injure you or your hood-mate. Liquids inside the funnel can leak while you shake. To avoid all of the above, frequent venting is a MUST.</span></p>
